# Programming and using Linux sound in depth

The original source files for the book "Programming and using Linux sound in depth".
The source files are a mixture of HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Java/C/etc
programs. The programs are pulled into the Web pages by a server-side
script 'escape.pl' which just rewrites funny HTML characters such as '<'. 
This allows 'live' inclusion of source files into the book.
That file lives in /usr/local/bin but is included in the toplevel directory.

These files directly generate the web pages on 
[jan.newmarch.name/LinuxSound](https://jan.newmarch.name/LinuxSound).

They are also used to generate the Markdown files on Gitbook for
[Programming and using Linux sound systems](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jannewmarch/programming-and-using-linux-sound-systems/details)
