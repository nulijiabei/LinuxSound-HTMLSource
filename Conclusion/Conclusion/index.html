    <h2> Where did we start? </h2>
    <p>
      The starting point for all this was
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  I have two Karaoke machines, each with different capabilities
	</li>
	<li>
	  I wanted to build a 'best of both worlds' machine from my computer(s)
	</li>
	<li>
	  My initial attempt using the Java Sound API worked, but suffered from
	  latency, enough to make it unusable
	</li>
	<li>
	  Atttempts to move any part of this Java solution to low-powered devices
	  like the Raspberry Pi just failed miserably
	</li>
      </ul>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Where did I get to? </h2>
    <p>
      Well, I got part way there.
      The system ended up consisting of
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  I have three types of Karaoke files
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      MP3+G files
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      KAR format Karaoke files
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      KAR files containing the lyrics with the music in .WMA files
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	  All of these files are stored on my (Linux) server
	</li>
	<li>
	  For playing the files, I have a CubieBoard2 connected to my
	  TV/HiFi system
	</li>
	<li>
	  I have a variety of devices to control the selection and playing
	  of files: Linux netbook, Linux laptop, several Android tablets
	  of different dimensions and even one Windows PC
	</li>
	<li>
	  The Linux and Windows boxes use a common Java program. The Android tablets
	  use...Android
	</li>
      </ul>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      I haven't ended up with a better Karaoke machine. Nevertheless, the system
      can play all of the file types, showing the lyrics and playing the music.
      It doesn't score, doesn't show a video in the background and doesn't
      show the notes that should be sung against the notes actually sung.
      Still to come :-(.
    </p>

    <h2> The Karaoke files </h2>
    <p>
      The Karaoke files are all stored on a server.
      They could be accessible from Samba, NFS, SSHFS, etc, etc.
      The only thing I can guarantee across Linux, Windows and Android
      is HTTP, so I just make the files available through an Apache
      server.
    </p>

    <p>
      The files are stored in subdirectories according to their source.
      For example, the files I ripped from the Sonken disk are in
      subdirectory <code>KARAOKE/Sonken</code>.
      These files can be accessed through a simple HTTP GET request,
      given the URL for the file.
    </p>

    <h2> Communicating choices </h2>
    <p>
      When a controller chooses a song, the URL needs to be communicated to the
      playing device. For commonality across Linux/Windows/Android clients, 
      a simple TCP connection is used.
      The bandwidth is not high, so to avoid possible blocks caused by
      the server crashing and clients holding TCP connections open, each client
      opens a TCP connection, 
      just sends a single URL across a connection and then closes it.
    </p>

    <h2> The Java controller </h2>
    <p>
      Information about each song is stored in a file <code>SongInformation.java</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . SongInformation.java" -->
      </pre>
<p>
      This includes methods to perform Boolean pattern matches on the object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiple songs are stored in a <code>SongTable</code> which is basically
      a <code>Vector</code> of <code>SongInformation</code> objects.
      This table is serialisable so that it can be stored and then loaded
      quickly from the HTTP server. 
      The class contains some messy code to initialise the table if it is
      serialised from a directory or from a list of files.
      Apart from that, it contains code to build a (smaller) song table from a set
      of pattern matches. This is useful from returning tables that meet
      a pattern such as the artist being the Beatles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The table is given by <code>SongTable.java</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . SongTable.java" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Swing song table UI </h2>
    <p>
      There is a principal song table containing all the songs.
      This may have filters applied to it to show, say, only the
      Beatles songs.
      In addition, the visitors to my house have built up a collection
      of "favourite" songs. Each of these is its own song table.
      The UI for this is the Swing application 
      <code>SongTableSwing.java</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . SongTableSwing.java" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      The favourites classes are 
      <code>AllFavourites.java</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . AllFavourites.java" -->
      </pre>
<p>
      and
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . Favourites.java" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> The audio player side </h2>
    <p>
      On the audio player, a service has to listen for URLs to be played.
      Each song will be pulled off the file server by an HTTP request
      (using a tool such as <code>wget</code>).
      This should maintain a queue of requests, playing the next song
      as the previous one completes. This should show the queue, so is
      implemented using a Java program showing a Swing list.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is <code>Player.java</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . Player.java" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      It contains buttons to control the speed of play
      and to stop play. More importantly, it hands control
      to different shell scripts based on the type of file
      downloaded.
    </p>

    <h2> Jack or PulseAudio? </h2>
    <p>
      One of the common requests is to raise or lower the pitch
      of a song. Jack can easily build a network of components,
      and if one of these is <code>jack-rack</code> then it can 
      use a LADPSA plugin, such as the TAP pitch plugin.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I use Jack.
    </p>

    <h2> Playing an MP3+G file </h2>
    <p>
      An Mp3+G pair is pulled off the server as a ZIP file.
      After unzipping, it can be played by <code>vlc</code>.
      <code>vlc</code> can use a Lua interface to which you
      can send commands such as "faster", "slower".
    </p>

    <p>
      The script is <code>playZip</code>
</p>
      <pre class="sh_sh">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . playZip" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Playing a KAR file </h2>
    <p>
      KAR files ripped of the Sonken player may have audio plus
      lyrics, or lyrics only with the audio in a linked WMA files.
      The MIDI player <code>timidity</code> can be used to play
      the KAR part, but for WMA files another player such as
      <code>mplayer</code> is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      An annoying part of <code>timidity</code> is that you cannot set the
      Jack output device to connect to. So you need to wait till it has
      registered with Jack, and then call <code>jack-connect</code>
      to link it to <code>jack-rack</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shell script is <code>playKar</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_sh">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . playKar" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> TiMidity plugin </h2>
    <p>
      The last bit of the puzzle is how TiMidity will show the
      lyrics. There is no supplied plugin that will display
      lyrics in the right format. The flags
      <code>--trace --trace-meta-text</code> will make
      the lyrics available in real-time to a plugin.
      I wrote one based on Xlib, with drawing done by Cairo and Pango.
      It  is
      <code>x_code.c</code>
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . x_code.c" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      All done! Well, as with anything, more can be done.
      But more will, I think, require use of the GPU in these
      small computers. Plus X is giving way to Wayland
      (or Mir on Ubuntu) and that should have hooks into
      the GPUs. So it's off to there I will probably go next.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regards, and good luck with your own projects!
