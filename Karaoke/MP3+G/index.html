	This chapter explores using Karaoke files in MP3+G
	format. Files are pulled off a server to a (small)
	computer attached to a display device (my TV).
	Files are chosen using a Java Swing application
	running on Linux or Windows, or by an Android
	application.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="generated-toc" class="generate_from_h2"></div>

    <h2> Files </h2>
    <p>
	Source files in this chapter are
	<a href="all.zip"> here </a>.

    </p>

    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
      In the chapter on <a href="../User/"> User level Karaoke tools</a>
      we discussed the MP3+G format for Karaoke.
      Each "song" consists of two files: an MP3 file for the audio
      and a low-quality CDG file for the video (mainly the lyrics).
      Often this pair of files are zipped together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Files can be extracted from CDG Karaoke disks by using
      <code>cdrdao</code> and <code>cdgrip.py</code>.
      They can be played by <code>vlc</code> when given the
      MP3 file as argument - it wil pick up the CDG file from
      the same directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people will have built up a sizeable collection of
      MP3+G songs. In this chapter we consider how to list and play
      them, along with keeping lists of favourite songs.
      The chapter just looks at a Java application to perform
      this, and is really just standard Swing and Android programming.
      There are no special audio or Karaoke features
      considered in this chapter.
    </p>

    <p>
      I keep my files on a server. I can access them in many ways on 
      the other computers in the house: SAMBA shares, HTTP downloads,
      SSH file system (sshfs), etc. Some mechanisms are less portable than
      others; for example sshfs is not a standard Windows application
      and SMB/SAMBA is not a standard Android client. So after getting
      everything working using sshfs (a no-brainer under standard Linux),
      I then converted the applications to HTTP access.
      This has its own wrinkles :-).
    </p>

    <p>
      The environment looks like
      <br/> <img alt="" src="env.png"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Java client application for Linux and Windows looks like
    </p>
      <figure>
	<figcaption>MP3+G player</figcaption>
	<img src="karaoke.png" alt="MP3+G player"/>
      </figure>
    <p>
      This shows the main window of songs and on its right
      the favourites window for two people, Jan and Linda.
      The application handles multiple languages - english,
      korean and chinese are shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      Filters can be applied to the main song list. For example,
      filtering on the singer Sting gives
    </p>
      <figure>
	<figcaption>Songs by Sting</figcaption>
	<img  src="sting.png" alt="Songs by Sting"/>
      </figure>
    

    <p>
      The Android application looks like
      XXX
    </p>

    <p>
      When <code>Play</code> is clicked, information about the selection
      is sent to the media player - currently a CubieBoard2 connected
      to my hifi/TV. The media computer fetches the files from
      the HTTP server.
      Files are played on the media computer using <code>vlc</code> as it can 
      handle MP3+G files.
    </p>

    <h2> File organisation </h2>
    <p>
      If MP3+G songs are ripped from CDG Karaoke disks, then
      a natural organisation would be to store the files in
      directories, each directory corresponding to one disk.
      More structure may be given by grouping the directories
      by common artist, or by style of music, etc.
      We just assume a directory structure with music files
      as leaf nodes. These files are kept on the HTTP server.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently have a large number of these files on my server.
      Information about these needs to be supplied to the clients.
      After a bit of experimentation a <code>Vector</code>
      of <code>SongInformation</code> is created and serialised
      using Java's object serialisation methods. The serialised
      file is also kept on the HTTP server. When a client
      starts up, it gets this file from the HTTP server
      and deserialises it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building this vector means walking the directory tree
      on the HTTP server and recording information as it goes.
      Java code to walk directory trees is fairly straightforward.
      It is a little tedious if you want it to be O/S independent.
      Java 1.7 introduced mechanisms to make this easier.
      These belong to the New I/O (NIO) system. The first
      class of importance is the 
      <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html">
	java.nio.file.Path</a>
      which "[is] an object that may be used to locate a 
      file in a file system. 
      It will typically represent a system dependent file path."
      A string representing a file location in, say, a Linux
      or a Windows file system can be turned into a <code>Path</code>
      object by
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
Path startingDir = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath(dirString);
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      Traversal of a file system from a given <code>path</code>
      is done by walking a file tree, calling a node "visitor"
      at each point. The visitor is a subclass of 
      <code>SimpleFileVisitor&lt;Path&gt;</code> 
      and for leaf nodes only you would override the
      method
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attr)
      </pre>
      The traversal is done by
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
Visitor pf = new Visitor();
Files.walkFileTree(startingDir, pf);
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      A full explanation of this is given in the Java Tutorials
      on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/walk.html">
	Walking the File Tree
      </a>.
      We use this to load all song information
      from disk into a vector of song
      paths in <code>SongTable.java</code>.
    </p>

    <h2> Song information </h2>
    <p>
      The information about each song should include its path
      in the file system, the name of the artist(s), the title
      of the song and any other useful information. This information
      has to be pulled out of the the file path of the song.
      In my current setup, files look like
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
/server/KARAOKE/Sonken/SK-50154 - Crosby, Stills - Carry On.mp3
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      Each song has a reasonably unique identifier ("SK-50154"),
      a unique path and an artist and title. 
      Reasonably straight-forward pattern matching code can
      extract these parts:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
Path file = ...
String fname = file.getFileName().toString();
if (fname.endsWith(".zip") || 
    fname.endsWith(".mp3")) {
    String root = fname.substring(0, fname.length()-4);
    String parts[] = root.split(" - ", 3);
    if (parts.length != 3)
        return;

	String index = parts[0];
	String artist = parts[1];
	String title = parts[2];

        SongInformation info = new SongInformation(file,
						   index,
						   title,
						   artist);
      </pre>
    <p>
      (The patterns produced by <code>cdrip.py</code>
      are not quite the same, but the code is easily changed.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>SongInformation</code> class captures this
      information and also includes methods for pattern matching
      of a string against the various fields. For example,
      to check if a title matches,
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
public boolean titleMatch(String pattern) {
    return title.matches("(?i).*" + pattern + ".*");
}
      </pre>
    <p>
      This gives a case-independent match using 
      Java regular expression support.
      See <a href="http://www.vogella.com/articles/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html">
	Java Regex Tutorial
      </a> by Lars Vogel for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
      The complete <code>SongInformation</code> file is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl Table SongInformation.java" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Song table </h2>
    <p>
      The <code>SongTable</code> builds up a vector of 
      <code>SongInformation</code> objects by traversing the file
      tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there are many songs (say, in the thousands)
      this can lead to a slow startup time. To reduce this,
      once a table is loaded, it is saved to disk as a persistent
      object by writing it to an <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>.
      The next time the program is started, an attempt is made to
      read it back from this using an <code>ObjectInputStream</code>.
      Note that we do <em>not</em> use the 
      <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_Java_persistence%3F">
	Java Persistence API
      </a> -
      designed for J2EE, it is too heavyweight for our purpose here.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      The <code>SongTable</code> also includes code to build 
      smaller song tables based on matches between patterns
      and the title (or artist or number). It can search
      for matches between a pattern and a song and build a new
      table based on the matches. It contains a pointer to
      the original table for restoration later.
      This allows searches for patterns to use the same
      data structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code for <code>SongTable</code> is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl Table SongTable.java" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Favourites </h2>
    <p>
      I've built this system for my home environment where I have
      a regular group of friends visiting. We each have our
      favourite songs to sing and so we have made up lists
      on scraps of paper which get lost, have wine spilt on them, etc.
      So this system includes favourite lists of songs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each favourites list is essentially just another
      <code>SongTable</code>. But I have put a <code>JList</code>
      around the table to display it. The <code>JList</code>
      uses a <code>DefaultListModel</code>, and
      the constructor loads a song table into this list
      by iterating through the table and adding elements
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	int n = 0;
	java.util.Iterator&lt;SongInformation&gt; iter = favouriteSongs.iterator();
	while(iter.hasNext()) {
	    model.add(n++, iter.next());
	}
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      Other Swing code adds three buttons along the bottom:
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Add song to list
	</li>
	<li>
	  Delete song from list
	</li>
	<li>
	  Play song
	</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      Adding a song to the list means taking the selected item
      from the main song table and adding it to this table.
      The main table is passed into the constructor and just
      kept for the purpose of getting its selection. The
      selected object is added to both the Swing <code>JList</code>
      and to the favourites <code>SongTable</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Playing a song" is done in a simple way: the full path
      to the song is written to standard output, newline
      terminated. Another program in a pipeline can then pick
      this up - see later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Favourites aren't much good if they don't persist from one
      day to the next! So the same object storage method as before is used 
      as with the full song table. Each favourites file is saved on each
      change. There are some Linux/Unix dependencies here, in that
      application information is stored in a subdirectory
      beginning with a "." in the user's home directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code for <code>Favourites</code> is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl Table Favourites.java" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> All favourites </h2>
    <p>
      There's nothing special here. It just loads the tables for
      each person and builds a <code>Favourites</code> object
      which it places in a <code>JTabbedPane</code>.
      It also adds in a "NEW" tab to add additional users.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code for <code>AllFavourites</code> is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl Table AllFavourites.java" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Swing song table </h2>
    <p>
      This is mainly code to get the different song tables loaded
      and to buld the Swing interface. It also filters the
      showing table based on patterns matched.
      The originally loaded table is kept for restoration and
      patching matching.
      The code for <code>SongTableSwing</code> is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl Table SongTableSwing.java" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Playing songs </h2>
    <p>
      Whenever a song is "played" its file path is written to standard output.
      This makes it suitable for use in a pipeline such as
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
VLC_OPTS="--play-and-exit --fullscreen"

java  SongTableSwing |
while read line
do
        if expr match "$line" ".*mp3"
        then
                vlc $VLC_OPTS "$line"
        elif expr match "$line" ".*zip"
        then
                rm -f /tmp/karaoke/*
                unzip -d /tmp/karaoke "$line"
                vlc $VLC_OPTS /tmp/karaoke/*.mp3
        fi
done
      </pre>
    

    <h2> VLC </h2>
    <p>
      VLC is an immensely flexible media player. It relies on a large set of plugins
      to enhance its basic core functionality. We saw in an earlier chapter that
      if a directory contains both an MP3 and a CDG file with the same basename
      then by asking it to play the MP3 file it will also show the CDG video.
    </p>

    <p>
      Common expectations of Karaoke players are that you can adjust the speed and pitch.
      Currently VLC cannot adjust pitch, but it does have a plugin to adjust speed
      (while keeping the pitch unchanged). This plugin can be accessed by the 
      <a href="http://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/share/lua/intf/cli.lua">Lua</a>
      interface to VLC. 
      Once set up, you can send commands such as
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
rate 1.04	  
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      across standard input from the process that started VLC (such as a
      command line shell). This will change the speed and leave the pitch
      unchanged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting up VLC to accept Lua commands from stdin can be done by the command options
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
vlc -I luaintf --lua-intf cli ...
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      Note that this takes away the standard GUI controls (menus, etc) and 
      controls VLC from stdin only.
    </p>

    <p>
      At present, it is not simple to add pitch control to VLC.
      Take a deep breath:
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Turn off PulseAudio and start Jack
	</li>
	<li>
	  Run <code>jack-rack</code> and install the <code>TAP_pitch</code> filter
	</li>
	<li>
	  Run VLC with Jack output
	</li>
	<li>
	  Using <code>qjackctl</code> hook VLC to output through 
	  <code>jack-rack</code>, which outputs to system
	</li>
	<li>
	  Control pitch through the <code>jack-rack</code> GUI
	</li>
      </ul>
    

    <h2> Playing songs across the network </h2>
    <p>
      I actually want to play songs from my server disk to a
      Raspberry Pi or CubieBoard connected to my TV,
      and control the play from a netbook sitting on my
      lap. (Later I will try to get Android code running to
      do the same.). This is a distributed system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mounting server files on a computer is simple: you can use
      NFS, Samba, ... I am currently using <code>sshfs</code> as in
    </p>
      <pre>
sshfs -o idmap=user -o rw -o allow_other newmarch@192.168.1.101:/home/httpd/html /server
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      For remote access/control I replace the <code>run</code> command
      of the last section by a TCP client/server. On the client,
      controlling the player, I have
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
java SongTableSwing | client 192.168.1.7
      </pre>
    <p>
      while on the (Raspberry Pi/CubieBoard) server I run
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
#!/bin/bash
set -x
VLC_OPTS="--play-and-exit -f"

server |
while read line
do
	if expr match "$line" ".*mp3"
	then
		vlc $VLC_OPTS "$line"
	elif expr match "$line" ".*zip"
	then
		rm -f /tmp/karaoke/*
		unzip -d /tmp/karaoke "$line"
		vlc $VLC_OPTS /tmp/karaoke/*.mp3
	fi
done
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      The client/server files are just standard TCP files.
      The client reads a newline-terminated string
      from standard input and writes it to the
      server, and the server prints the same line to standard output.
      Here is <code>client.c</code>:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl Table client.c" -->
      </pre>
    <p>
      and here is <code>server.c</code>
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl Table server.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      This chapter has built a player for MP3+G files.
