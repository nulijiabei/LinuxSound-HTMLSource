	FluidSynth is an application for playing MIDI files and a library
	for MIDI applications. It does not have the hooks for playing 
	Karaoke files. This chapter discusses an extension to 
	FluidSynth which adds appropriate hooks, and then uses
	these to build a variety of Karaoke systems.

    <h2> Players </h2>
    <p>
      <code>fluidsynth</code> is a command line MIDI player.
      It runs under ALSA with a command line
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
fluidsynth -a alsa -l &lt;soundfont&gt; &lt;files...&gt;
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>
    


    <h2> Play MIDI files </h2>
    <p>
      The FluidSynth API consists of 
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  A sequencer created using <code>new_fluid_player</code>
	</li>
	<li>
	  A synthesizer created using <code>new_fluid_synth</code>
	</li>
	<li>
	  An audio player created using <code>new_fluid_audio_driver</code>
	  which runs in a separate thread
	</li>
	<li>
	  A "settings" object which can be used to control many features
	  of the other components, created by <code>new_fluid_settings</code>
	  and modified by calls such as <code>fluid_settings_setstr</code>
	</li>
      </ul>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical program to play a sequence of MIDI files using ALSA follows.
      It creates the various objects, sets the audio player to use ALSA
      and then adds each soundfont and MIDI file to the player.
      The call to <code>fluid_player_play</code> then plays each MIDI file
      in turn.
      This program is just a repeat of the program seen in the chapter
      on 
      <a href="../../MIDI/FluidSynth/">FluidSynth MIDI</a>.
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . file_player.c" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Extending FluidSynth with callbacks </h2>
    <p>
      Callbacks are functions registered with an application which
      are called when certain events occur. In order to build a Karaoke
      player we need to know
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  When a file is loaded so that we can extract all of the lyrics
	  from it for display at the right times.
	</li>
	<li>
	  When each Meta Lyric or Text event occurs as output from
	  a sequencer, so that we can see what lyric is about to be
	  sung.
	</li>
      </ul>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first of these is fairly straightforward: FluidSynth
      has a function <code>fluid_player_load</code> which will
      load a file. We can change the code to add a suitable callback into that
      function which will give us access to the loaded MIDI file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Getting Lyric or Text events out of a sequencer is not so easy, since they
      are never meant to appear! The MIDI specification allows these
      event types within a MIDI file, but they are not wire-types so
      should never be sent from a sequencer to a synthesizer.
      The Java MIDI API makes them available by an out-of-band call
      to a Meta event handler. FluidSynth just throws them away.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, FluidSynth already has a callback to handle
      MIDI events sent from the sequencer to the synthesizer. It is
      the function <code>fluid_synth_handle_midi_event</code>
      and is set by the call <code>fluid_player_set_playback_callback</code>.
      What we need to do is to firstly alter the 
      existing FluidSynth code so that Lyric and
      Text events are passed through, and then insert a new playback
      callback that will intercept those events and do something
      with them while passing on all other events to the default
      handler. The default handler will ignore any such events
      anyway, so it does not need to be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have added one new function to FluidSynth,
      <code>fluid_player_set_onload_callback</code>
      and added appropriate code to pass on some Meta
      events. Then it is a matter of writing an onload
      callback to walk through the MIDI data from the parsed
      input file, and writing a suitable MIDI event callback
      to handle the intercepted Meta events while passing the rest
      through to the default handler.
    </p>

    <p>
      These changes have been made to give a new source
      package 
      <a href="fluidsynth-1.1.6-karaoke.tar.bz2">
	fluidsynth-1.1.6-karaoke.tar.bz2
      </a>.
      If you just want to work from a patch file, that is
      <a href="fluid.patch">
	fluid.patch
      </a>.
      The patch has been submitted to the FluidSynth
      maintainers.
    <p>

    <p>
      To build from this package, do the same as you normally
      would:
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
tar jxf fluidsynth-1.1.6-karaoke.tar.bz2
cd fluidsynth-1.1.6
./configure
make clean
make
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
      To get ALSA support, you will need to have installed
      the <code>libasound2-dev</code> package, and similarly
      for Jack or other packages. You probably won't have  many
      of them installed, so
      don't run <code>make install</code> or you will overwrite
      the normal <code>fluidsynth</code> package which will 
      probably have more features.
    </p>

    <p>
      The previous program modified to just print out
      the lyric lines and the lyric events as they occur
      is <code>karaoke_player.c</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . karaoke_player.c" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming the new fluidsynth package is in an immediate subdirectory,
      to compile the program you will need  to pick up the local 
      includes and libraries
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
gcc -g -I fluidsynth-1.1.6/include/ -I fluidsynth-1.1.6/src/midi/ -I fluidsynth-1.1.6/src/utils/ -c -o karaoke_player.o karaoke_player.c

gcc karaoke_player.o -Lfluidsynth-1.1.6/src/.libs -l fluidsynth -o karaoke_player
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      To run the program, you will also need to pick up the local library
      and the soundfont file:
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./fluidsynth-1.1.6/src/.libs/
./karaoke_player /usr/share/soundfonts/FluidR3_GM.sf2 54154.mid
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      The output for a typical <code>KAR</code> file is
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
Load callback, tracks 1 
Track 0
Loaded event #
Loaded event 0
Loaded event 0
Loaded event 0
Loaded event 1
Loaded event 

...

Callback: Playing lyric event 2 #
Callback: Playing lyric event 2 0
Callback: Playing lyric event 2 0
Callback: Playing lyric event 2 0
Callback: Playing lyric event 2 1
Callback: Playing lyric event 3 
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Displaying and colouring text with Gtk </h2>
    <p>
      While there are many ways in which Karaoke text can be
      displayed, a common pattern is to display two lines of
      text, the currently playing line and the next one.
      The current line is progressively highlighted and 
      on completion is
      replaced by the next line. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Java chapter we did that. But the Java libraries have
      not been polished and are distinctly slow and heavyweight.
      They also seem to be low on Oracle's development schedule
      for Java.
      So here we look at an alternative GUI and make use of the
      FluidSynth library. The Gtk library is chosen for reasons
      outlined in an
      <a href="../../Diversions/Gtk/"> earlier chapter </a>
      on Gtk.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first task is to build up an array of lyric lines 
      as the file is loaded. We are asssuming KAR format files
      with upfront information as to title, etc, prefixed
      by '@', and newlines prefixed by '\'.
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
        <code>
struct _lyric_t {
    gchar *lyric;
    long tick;
};
typedef struct _lyric_t lyric_t;

struct _lyric_lines_t {
    char *language;
    char *title;
    char *performer;
    GArray *lines; // array of GString *
};
typedef struct _lyric_lines_t lyric_lines_t;

GArray *lyrics;
lyric_lines_t lyric_lines;

void build_lyric_lines() {
    int n;
    lyric_t *plyric;
    GString *line = g_string_new("");
    GArray *lines =  g_array_sized_new(FALSE, FALSE, sizeof(GString *), 64);

    lyric_lines.title = NULL;

    for (n = 0; n &lt; lyrics-&gt;len; n++) {
	plyric = g_array_index(lyrics, lyric_t *, n);
	gchar *lyric = plyric-&gt;lyric;
	int tick = plyric-&gt;tick;

	if ((strlen(lyric) &gt;= 2) &amp;&amp; (lyric[0] == '@') &amp;&amp; (lyric[1] == 'L')) {

	    if (lyric_lines.title == NULL) {
		lyric_lines.title = lyric + 2;
	    } else {
		lyric_lines.performer = lyric + 2;
	    }
	    continue;
	}

	if (lyric[0] == '@') {
	    // some other stuff like @KMIDI KARAOKE FILE
	    continue;
	}

	if ((lyric[0] == '/') || (lyric[0] == '\\')) {
	    // start of a new line
	    // add to lines
	    g_array_append_val(lines, line);
	    line = g_string_new(lyric + 1);
	}  else {
	    line = g_string_append(line, lyric);
	}
    }
    lyric_lines.lines = lines;
    
    printf("Title is %s, performer is %s, language is %s\n", 
	   lyric_lines.title, lyric_lines.performer, lyric_lines.language);
    for (n = 0; n &lt; lines->len; n++) {
	printf("Line is %s\n", g_array_index(lines, GString *, n)->str);
    }  
}
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is called from the onload callback
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
int onload_callback(void *data, fluid_player_t *player) {
    long ticks = 0L;
    lyric_t *plyric;

    for (n = 0; n &lt; player-&gt;ntracks; n++) {

	printf("Track %d\n", n);
	fluid_midi_event_t *event = fluid_track_first_event(track);
	while (event != NULL) {
	    switch (fluid_midi_event_get_type (event)) {
	    case MIDI_TEXT:
	    case MIDI_LYRIC:
		/* there's no fluid_midi_event_get_sysex()
		   or fluid_midi_event_get_time() so we 
		   have to look inside the opaque struct
		*/
		ticks += event-&gt;dtime;
		printf("Loaded event %s for time %d\n", 
		       event-&gt;paramptr,
		       ticks);
		plyric = g_new(lyric_t, 1);
		plyric-&gt;lyric = g_strdup(event-&gt;paramptr);
		plyric-&gt;tick = ticks;
		g_array_append_val(lyrics, plyric);
	    }
	    event = fluid_track_next_event(track);
	}
    }

    printf("Saved %d lyric events\n", lyrics-&gt;len);
    for (n = 0; n &lt; lyrics-&gt;len; n++) {
	plyric = g_array_index(lyrics, lyric_t *, n);
	printf("Saved lyric %s at %d\n", plyric-&gt;lyric, plyric-&gt;tick);
    }

    build_lyric_lines();
}
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      The standard GUI part is to build an interface consisting of
      two labels, one above the other to hold lines of lyrics.
      This is just ordinary Gtk.
    </p>

    <p>
      The final part is to handle lyric or text events from the
      sequencer. If the event is a '\', then the current text
      in a label must be replaced with new text, afer a small
      pause. Otherwise, the text in the label has to be
      progressively coloured to indicate what is next
      to be played.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the  <a href="../../Diversions/Gtk/"> earlier chapter </a>
      on Gtk we discussed using Cairo to draw in pixbufs, and 
      Pango to structure the text. The Gtk Label understands
      Pango directly, so we just use Pango to format the 
      text and display it in the label. This involves
      constructing an HTML string with the first part coloured
      red and the rest in black. This can be set in the label,
      and there is no need to use Cairo.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is <code>gtkkaraoke_player.c</code>
      <em>Warning: the following program crashes regularly
	when trying to copy a Pango attribute list in the Gtk code
	for sizing
	a label. Debugging shows that the Pango copy function
	is set to NULL somewhere in Gtk, and shouldn't be. 
	I have no fix as yet and haven't replicated the bug 
	in a simple enough way to log a bug report.
      </em>

    <h2> Playing a background video with Gtk </h2>
    <p>
      The chapter on
      <a href="../../Diversions/Gtk/"> Gtk </a>
      showed how to play a background video with images (using Pixbufs),
      text (using Cairo) and coloured text (using Pango).
      We can extend that by adding in the dynamic text display
      for playing Karaoke. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We capture each lyric line in a structure which keeps the whole
      of the line, the part that has been sung already, the Pango
      markup for the line and the Pango attributes:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
typedef struct _coloured_line_t {
    gchar *line;
    gchar *front_of_line;
    gchar *marked_up_line;
    PangoAttrList *attrs;
} coloured_line_t;
      </pre>
<p>
      This is updated each time a MIDI Lyric event occurs, in a
      thread listening to the FluidSynth sequencer.
    </p>

    <p>
      A separate thread plays the video, and on each frame overlays
      the frame image with the current and next lyric.
      This is set into a <code>GdkImage</code> for display
      by Gtk.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is <code>gtkkaraoke_player_video_pango.c</code>
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . gtkkaraoke_player_video_pango.c" -->
      </pre>


    <p>
      The application looks like <br/>
      <img alt="" src="pango.png"/>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      By extending FluidSynth it an be made into a Karaoke player in various
      ways. It is quite heavy in CPU usage though. On my laptop, the final version
      runs at about 100% CPU.
