    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
      TiMidity is a MIDI player, not a Karaoke player.
      By default it just plays the MIDI music, with the lyrics
      printed out:
</p>
     <pre>

      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      But it has
      a number of alternative interfaces which give different displays. 
      If you run
      <code>timidity</code> with the <code>-h</code> (help)
      option, it will show a screen including something like
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
Available interfaces (-i, --interface option):
  -in          ncurses interface
  -ie          Emacs interface (invoked from `M-x timidity')
  -ia          XAW interface
  -id          dumb interface
  -ir          remote interface
  -iA          ALSA sequencer interface
	</code>
      </pre>.
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      The default interface is "dumb", but if you run with, say, the XAW
      interface you get a display like <br/>
      <img alt="" src="timidity-xaw.png"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      There is, however, one unfortunate effect: the lyrics are displayed
      <em>before</em> they are due to be played! 
      To get the lyrics played just as they should be sung,
      you need to turn on the
      <code>--trace</code> option. From the man page,
      "Toggles  trace  mode.   In trace mode, TiMidity++ attempts to
       display its current state in real time."
      You may find the link between documentation and behaviour
      a lttle less than obvious...
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity --trace ../54154.mid
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      This now works fine for MIDI files, the lyrics are displayed
      when they should be sung. But it doesn't display the lyrics
      for <code>.KAR</code> files. For that you need the
      <code>--trace-text-meta</code> option:
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity --trace --trace-text-meta ../54154.kar
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      So by this stage, TiMidity will display the lyrics on the screen
      in realtime for Karaoke files (and MIDI files with LYRIC events).
      To have our own control over this display, we need to build our
      own TiMidity interface.
    </p>

    <h2> TiMidity and Jack </h2> 
    <p>
      In the MIDI chapter on 
      <a href="../../MIDI/User/">User space tools</a>
      we discussed playing MIDI files using Jack.
      Jack is designed to link audio sources and sinks in
      arbitrary configurations. By running <code>qjackctl</code>
      you can link, for example, microphone outputs to
      speaker inputs.
      This is done by dragging "capture_1" to "playback_1" etc
      and appears like
      <br/> <img alt="" src="in_2_out.png"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      If TiMidity is then run with Jack output, you get instant
      Karaoke. You can also see the lyrics played in real time
      using the <code>--trace</code> option:
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity -Oj --trace 54154.mid
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
      The connections are shown in <code>qjackctl</code> as
      <br/> <img alt="" src="timidity_jack.png"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      The lyric display is klunky, and will be improved later.
    </p>

    <h2> TiMidity interface </h2>
    <p>
      You will need to have the TiMidity source downloaded
      from
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/timidity/?source=dlp">
	SourceForge TiMidity++
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the earlier chapter on
      <a href="../../MIDI/Timidity/">MIDI and TiMidity</a>
      we discussed two alternative ways of building applications
      using TiMidity:
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Build a front-end with TiMidity as a library back-end
	</li>
	<li>
	  Use standard TiMidity with a custom-built interface
	  as back-end to TiMidity
	</li>
      </ul>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      Both options are possible here, with one wrinkle: if we want to 
      capture MIDI events then we have to do so as a back-end to TiMidity, which
      requires that we build a TiMidity interface.
    </p>


    <p>
      To recap on this,
      the different interface files for TiMidity are stored in the
      directory <code>interface</code> and include files such as
      <code>dumb_c.c</code> for the dumb interface. They all revolve
      around a data structure <code>ControlMode</code>
       defined in <code>timidity/controls.h</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
typedef struct {
  char *id_name, id_character;
  char *id_short_name;
  int verbosity, trace_playing, opened;

  int32 flags;

  int  (*open)(int using_stdin, int using_stdout);
  void (*close)(void);
  int (*pass_playing_list)(int number_of_files, char *list_of_files[]);
  int  (*read)(int32 *valp);
  int  (*write)(char *buf, int32 size);
  int  (*cmsg)(int type, int verbosity_level, char *fmt, ...);
  void (*event)(CtlEvent *ev);  /* Control events */
} ControlMode;
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
     .
    </p>

    <p>
      For the simplest values of the functions in this structure,
      see the code for the dumb interface in 
      <code>interface/dumb_c.c</code>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For dealing with lyrics, the main field to set is the 
      function <code>event()</code>. This will be passed a
      pointer to a <code>CtlEvent</code> which is
      defined in <code>timidity/controls.h</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
typedef struct _CtlEvent {
    int type;           /* See above */
    ptr_size_t v1, v2, v3, v4;/* Event value */
} CtlEvent;
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The type field distinguishes a large number of event types
      such as <code>CTLE_NOW_LOADING</code> and <code>CTLE_PITCH_BEND</code>.
      The type of interest to us is <code>CTLE_LYRIC</code>.
</p>
      Typical code to handle this is in <code>interface/dumb_c.c</code>
      which prints event information to output:
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
static void ctl_event(CtlEvent *e)
{
    switch(e-&gt;type) {
      case CTLE_LYRIC:
        ctl_lyric((int)e-&gt;v1);
        break;
   }
}

static void ctl_lyric(int lyricid)
{
    char *lyric;

    lyric = event2string(lyricid);
    if(lyric != NULL)
    {
        if(lyric[0] == ME_KARAOKE_LYRIC)
        {
            if(lyric[1] == '/' || lyric[1] == '\\')
            {
                fprintf(outfp, "\n%s", lyric + 2);
                fflush(outfp);
            }
            else if(lyric[1] == '@')
            {
                if(lyric[2] == 'L')
                    fprintf(outfp, "\nLanguage: %s\n", lyric + 3);
                else if(lyric[2] == 'T')
                   fprintf(outfp, "Title: %s\n", lyric + 3);
                else
                    fprintf(outfp, "%s\n", lyric + 1);
            }
            else
            {
                fputs(lyric + 1, outfp);
                fflush(outfp);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            if(lyric[0] == ME_CHORUS_TEXT || lyric[0] == ME_INSERT_TEXT)
                fprintf(outfp, "\r");
            fputs(lyric + 1, outfp);
            fflush(outfp);
        }
    }
}
	</code>
      </pre>

    <h2> Adding an interface to TiMidity </h2>
    <p>
      You can add your own interface to the <code>interface</code>
      directory. Then it can be made part of the TiMidity build.
      Good luck - I gave up after I discovered that the Gnu
      <a href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Mirrored/autoconf-2.12/autoconf_toc.html">
	autoconf
      </a> and
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/index.html#SEC_Contents">
	automake
      </a> tools in my current distro (Ubuntu 13.04) were
</p>
      incompatable with the versions used to prepare TiMidity
      2.14.0.
      <em> Since discovered that by running <code>autoscan</code> first
	that it may work better.
      Checkout <a href="http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Making-configure-Scripts.html#Making-configure-Scripts">
	  Making configure Scripts
	</a>
      </em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to try, here is what you have to do
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Add to interface.h.in:
	  <pre class="sh_cpp">
	    <code>
/* Define if you have KARAOKE interface. */
#undef IA_KARAOKE
	    </code>
	  </pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Add to timidity/controls.c:
	  <pre  class="sh_cpp">
	    <code>
#ifdef IA_KARAOKE
  extern ControlMode karaoke_control_mode;
# ifndef DEFAULT_CONTROL_MODE
#  define DEFAULT_CONTROL_MODE &karaoke_control_mode
# endif
#endif
	    </code>
	  </pre>
<p>
	  and add to the <code>ctl_list</code>
	  <pre  class="sh_cpp">
	    <code>
ControlMode *ctl_list[]={
   ...
#ifdef IA_KARAOKE
  &amp;karaoke_control_mode,
#endif
   ...
};
	    </code>
	  </pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Add your file <code>karaoke_c.c</code> to
	  the <code>interface</code> directory.
	  The file should have content such as
	  <pre  class="sh_cpp">
	    <code>
#define ctl karaoke_control_mode

ControlMode ctl=
    {
        "karaoke interface", 'k',
        "karaoke",
        1,          /* verbosity */
        0,          /* trace playing */
        0,          /* opened */
        0,          /* flags */
        ctl_open,
        ctl_close,
        pass_playing_list,
        ctl_read,
        NULL,       /* write */
        cmsg,
        ctl_event
    };

...

ControlMode *interface_k_loader(void)
{
    return &amp;ctl;
}
	    </code>
	  </pre>

	</li>
	<li>
	  Add a section to <code>configure.in</code>
	  <pre>
	    <code>
dnl KARAOKE
AM_CONDITIONAL(ENABLE_KARAOKE, false)
CONFIG_INTERFACE(karaoke,KARAOKE,k,
  AS_HELP_STRING([- -enable-karaoke], [Enable KAROAKE interface          (default is no)]),
  ,
  [ INTERFACE_SRCS="$INTERFACE_SRCS karaoke_c.c" ])
	    </code>
	  </pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you want to use Gtk for UI, you have to add their libraries
	  in as well - see the entry for Gtk 2.0
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you also want to support Gtk 3.0 you need to add 
	  <code>/usr/share/aclocal/gtk-3.0.m4</code> to the
	  <code>autoconf</code> directory, and add <code>gtk-3.0</code>
	  to <code>autoconf/Makefile.am</code>
	</li>
	<li>
	  I didn't find suitable macros to support FFMpeg
	</li>
	<li>
	  Then run <code>automake</code>,
	  <code>autoconf</code> and <code>configure</code>.
	  That's when I gave up due to tool version changes. 
	</li>
      </ul>

    <h2> Getting the list of lyrics </h2>
    <p>
      The failing of the current interfaces in TiMidity with regard
      to Karaoke is that while they can show the lyrics as they are played,
      they don't show the lyric lines and progressively highlight them as they are
      played. For that, you need the set of lyrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      TiMidity in fact builds a list of lyrics, and makes them accessible.
      It has a function <code>event2string()</code> which
      takes an integer parameter from one upwards. For each value
      it returns the string of a lyric or text event, finally
      returning <code>NULL</code> on the end of the list.
      The first character returned is a type parameter, the rest is
      the string. Using GLib functions, we can build up an array
      of lines for a <code>KAR</code> file by
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
struct _lyric_t {
    gchar *lyric;
    long tick; // not used here
};
typedef struct _lyric_t lyric_t;

struct _lyric_lines_t {
    char *language;
    char *title;
    char *performer;
    GArray *lines; // array of GString *
};
typedef struct _lyric_lines_t lyric_lines_t;

GArray *lyrics;
lyric_lines_t lyric_lines;

static void build_lyric_lines() {
    int n;
    lyric_t *plyric;
    GString *line = g_string_new("");
    GArray *lines =  g_array_sized_new(FALSE, FALSE, sizeof(GString *), 64);

    lyric_lines.title = NULL;

    n = 1;
    char *evt_str;
    while ((evt_str = event2string(n++)) != NULL) {
        gchar *lyric = evt_str+1;

        if ((strlen(lyric) &gt;= 2) &amp;&amp; (lyric[0] == '@') &amp;&amp; (lyric[1] == 'L')) {

        if ((lyric[0] == '/') || (lyric[0] == '\\')) {
            // start of a new line
            // add to lines
            g_array_append_val(lines, line);
            line = g_string_new(lyric + 1);

    }
}

      </pre>
<p>

    <p>
      The function <code>build_lyric_lines()</code> should be called
      from the <code>CTLE_LOADING_DONE</code> branch of
      <code>ctl_event()</code>.
    </p>

    <h2> TiMidity options </h2>

<!--
    <p>
      TiMidity as an application is in control. You can change 
      some parts of behaviour such as responding to events by adding
      to or changing interfaces. We hit this problem in the
      chapter on 
      <a href="../../MIDI/Timidity/">
	MIDI TiMidity
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that chapter we looked at how to turn TiMidity into a library
      to be called from our controlling code. For a Karoake system,
      we don't want to just play a single MIDI file, or even a fixed
      list of files given on the command line. Instead, we want to
      be able to choose files dynamically and call TiMidity on those
      files. So treating TiMidity as a library is the way we want to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      But on the other hand, we want to use the event sequencing
      features of TiMidity to display lyrics when they should be sung.
      So we want both TiMidity as a library and some of our own
      code treated as though it were a TiMidity interface.
    </p>
-->

    <p>
      If we choose to use TiMidity as front-end then we need to run it
</p>
      with suitable options. These include turning tracing on and
      also dynamically loading our new interface.
      This can be done for example by
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity -d. -iv --trace  --trace-text-meta ...
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
      for a "v" interface in the current directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The alternative is building a
      main program that calls TiMidity as a library. The command
      line parameters to TiMidity then have to be included as hard-coded
      parameters in the application. 
      One is easy: the <code>CtlMode</code> has a field
      <code>trace_playing</code> and setting that to one turns tracing on.
      Including Text events as Lyric events requires digging a bit deeper
      into TiMidity, but just requires (shortly after initialising
      the library)

      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
extern int opt_trace_text_meta_event;
opt_trace_text_meta_event = 1;
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <!--
    <p>
      We are going to cheat too:
      instead of dynamically loading our interface, we will just
      re-assign the <code>ctl</code> variable to our Karaoke
      version, which we will build outside of the TiMidity code base.

      This enough to use TiMidity as a library with hooks for
      a Karaoke player.

    <h2> Playing lyrics using Pnago + Cairo + Xlib </h2>
    <p>
      I want to be able to play my Karaoke files on the Raspberry Pi and similar 
      Systems on a Chip (SOCs). Unfortuanately the rapsberry Pi has a grossly
      underpowered CPU, so I have ended up using a 
      <a href="http://cubieboard.org/2013/06/19/cubieboard2-is-here/">CubieBoard 2</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even then I don't know how to program the GPU, so anything involving heavy graphics
      is not possible on this CPU. Any of the MIDI players hit close to (or over) 100%
      CPU usage just be themselves. So the system discussed in the next section,
      showing background video, isn't feasible.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section we use TiMidity as MIDI player with a minimal backend to display
      the lyrics as they are played. The lowest level of GUI support is used, namely
      Xlib. This can be used to draw text using low-level Xlib calls such as
      <code>XDrawImageString</code>. This wrks fine with ASCII languages, and with
      appropriate font choices, with other languages in the ISO-8859 family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Asian languages are harder to deal with in standard C. They involve one or two byte 
      characters when using an encoding such as UTF-8. To manage these. it is easiest
      to switch to a library designed to handle them such, such as Cairo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cairo is good for drawing simple text. For e.g. Chinese characters you have to
      find a font that will allow you to draw them. Alternatively, you can jump
      up one further level to Pango. Pango looks after all the font issues and
      produces glyphs which are sent to the X server.
    </p>


    <p>
      that approach is adopted in the following interface, <code>x_code.c</code>
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . x_code.c" -->
      </pre>
<p>
      it is compiled by
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
        gcc  -fPIC $(CFLAGS) -c -o x_code.o x_code.c $(LIBS)
        gcc -shared -o if_x.so x_code.o $(LIBS)
      </pre>
<p>
      and run by
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
timidity -d. -ix --trace --trace-text-meta ...
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>


    <h2> Playing a background video with Gtk </h2>

   
    <p>
      In the chapter on
      <a href="../FluidSynth/"> FluidSynth </a> case:
      we discussed a program to show lyrics overlaid onto
      a movie. Apart from the above considerations,
      the rest of the application follows similarly to the 
      FluidSynth case:
      build a set of lyric lines, display them using
      Pango over Gtk Pixbufs, and when a new lyric event
      occurs update the corresponding colours in the lyric
      line. 
    </p>

    <p>
      All of the dynamic action needs to occur out of the back-end of TiMidity.
      particularly in the function <code>ctl_event</code>.
      Other parts such as initialising FFMpeg and Gtk must also occur
      in the back-end when using standard TiMidity. If TiMidity is used
      as a library, this initialisation could occur in the front or the
      back. For simplicity, we just place it all in the back in
      the file <code>video_code.c</code>:

</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . video_code.c" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Background video with TiMidity as library </h2>
    <p>
      The code for this follows the same structure as the code
      in the <a href="../..MIDI/Timidity/"> MIDI TiMidity</a>
      chapter. It is is in the file 
      <code>gtkkaraoke_player_video_pango.</code>:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . gtkkaraoke_player_video_pango.c" -->
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

   <h2> Background video with TiMidity as front-end </h2>
    <p>
      The interface needs to be built as a shared library by
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
if_video.so: video_code.c
        gcc  -fPIC $(CFLAGS) -c -o video_code.o video_code.c $(LIBS)
        gcc -shared -o if_video.so video_code.o $(LIBS)
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      TiMidity is then run with options
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity -d. -iv --trace  --trace-text-meta 
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
      As before, it crashes TiMidity from the Ubuntu distro
      but works fine with TiMidity built from source in
      the current Linux environment.
    </p>
      
    <h2> Adding microphone input </h2>
    <p>
      At this stage we have a single application which can play a MIDI file,
      play a background movie and display highlighted lyrics on top of
      the video. There is no microphone input to sing along.
    </p>

    <p>
      Singing along can be handled either within this application or by an
      external process. if we want to include it in the current application
      then we will have to build a mixer for two audio streams. 
      Java does this in the JavaSound package, but in C we would need to
      do that ourselves. Now I think that can be done in ALSA, but at present
      their mixer code is gobbledygook to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jack makes it easy to mix audio - from different <em>processes</em>.
      The earlier section showed how to do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      My long term goal is to include scoring, etc. I need to split out the
      GUI code into a process that can also deal with microphone input.
      The Gtk interface in TiMidity is a "separate process" model,
      so I'll build on that - when I have Jack under control.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em> This section is a place-holder for now. </em>
    </p>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      This chapter has shown how to use TiMidity as MIDI player
      for a Karaoke system. On my laptop it uses less than 60% of CPU
      with Gtk 3.0,
      better than the 100% of FluidSynth.

<!--
Add "karaoke" to TiMidity configure.in
and

dnl KARAOKE
AM_CONDITIONAL(ENABLE_KARAOKE, false)
CONFIG_INTERFACE(karaoke,KARAOKE,k,
  AS_HELP_STRING([- -enable-karaoke], [Enable KAROAKE interface          (default is no)]),
  ,
  [ INTERFACE_SRCS="$INTERFACE_SRCS karaoke_c.c" ])


Add to interface.h.in:

/* Define if you have KARAOKE interface. */
#undef IA_KARAOKE

Add to timidity/controls.c:

#ifdef IA_KARAOKE
  extern ControlMode karaoke_control_mode;
# ifndef DEFAULT_CONTROL_MODE
#  define DEFAULT_CONTROL_MODE &karaoke_control_mode
# endif
#endif

ControlMode *ctl_list[]={
#ifdef IA_NCURSES
  &ncurses_control_mode,
#endif
#ifdef IA_VT100
  &vt100_control_mode,
#endif
#ifdef IA_KARAOKE
  &karaoke_control_mode,
#endif


Run autoconf
Add karaoke_c.c to interfaces, and gtk to get GTK libs(can improve)
Run ./configure - -enable-interface=karaoke - -enable-interface=gtk
./configure  - -enable-audio=alsa - -enable-karaoke - -enable-gtk - -enable-debug
make


To add GTK 3.0:

copy gtk-3.0.m4 from  /usr/share/aclocal/gtk-3.0.m4 to autoconf
add gtk-3.0 to autoconf/Makefile.am
