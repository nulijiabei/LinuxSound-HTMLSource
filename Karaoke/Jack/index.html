    <h2> Using jack rack for effects </h2>
    <p>
      Karaoke takes inputs from MIDI sources and from
      microphones. These are mixed together.
      Generally there is an overall volume
      control but there is usually a volume control
      for the microphones as well.
      While the MIDI source should be passed straight through,
      it is common to apply a reverb effect to the microphones.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are all effects that can be supplied by
      LADSPA modules (see the
      <a href="../../DSP/LADSPA/">LADSPA</a> chapter).
      The Jack application <code>jack-rack</code>
      makes these plugins accessible to Jack
      applications so that LADSPA effects can be applied
      to Jack pipelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is fairly straighforward to add a module
      to a session. Click on the "+" button and
      choose from the enormous menu of effects.
      For example, choosing the Karaoke plugin
      from the Utilities menu looks like
      <br/><img alt="" src="karaoke.png"/><br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the modules that might be relevant are
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Karaoke (number 1409) which shows under the Utilities menu.
	  This will attempt to remove centre vocals from a music
	  track.
	</li>
	<li>
	  There are a number of reverb modules which show
	  under the Simulators -&gt; Reverb menus
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      GVerb
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Plate reverb
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      TAP reverberator (from the TAP plugins)
	    </li>
	  </ul>
<p>
	  The TAP reverberator seems to be the most
	  full featured (but is not guaranteed to be realtime).
	</li>
	<li>
	  There are a number of amplifiers under
	  Amplitude -&gt; Amplifiers
	</li>
      </ul>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiple modules may be applied in a single
      <code>jack-rack</code> application, and
      multiple applications can be run.
      For example, to apply a volume control to a microphone
      and then apply reverb before sending to the speakers
      can be done by adding  the TAP reverberator and then
      one of the amplifiers. This looks like
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm running this on a USB Sound Blaster TruStudioPro.
      This is only 16-bits and I can't seem to find a suitable
      Jack hardware configuration.
      So I'm running Jack by hand using a plug device,
      which Jack complains about but works anyway:
</p>
       <pre>
	 <code>
jackd -dalsa -dplughw:2 -r 48000
	 </code>
       </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      Although <code>gladish</code> can see it under its
      Jack configuration menu,
      I haven't managed to get <code>gladish</code> to
      accept the SoundBlaster as a setting - so far I can only
      manage to get Jack running under as a plug device
      and gladish keeps swapping it back to a hardware
      device.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>qjackctl</code> does an okay job of
      saving and restoring sessions, starting
      <code>jack-rack</code> with its correct
      plugins and their settings, and linking
      it to the correct capture and playback ports.
    <p>
      
      <h2> Playing MIDI </h2>
    <p>
      The major synthesizer engines TiMidity and FluidSynth
      will output to ALSA devices. To bring them into the
      Jack world, Jack needs to be started with the
      <code>-Xseq</code> option or for <code>a2jmidid</code>
      to be run.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can try to manage the connections using the Jack
      session manager (e.g. <code>qjackctl</code>).
      But this hits a snag using the MIDI synthesizers
      such as TiMidity or FluidSynth
      since they assume a PulseAudio output rather
      than Jack output. 
      Restoring a session fails to restore the synthesizer
      with Jack output.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can try to manage the connections using LADSPA.
      Unfortunately I have so far been unable to manage
      the Jack server settings using <code>gladish</code>.
      So it starts Jack using the default ALSA settings
      and doesn't use the <code>-Xseq</code> setting
      to map the ALSA ports to Jack.
      We need to start <code>a2jmidid</code>
      and then it can succesfully manage a session of e.g
      <code>timidity</code>, <code>jack_keyboard</code> and 
      <code>a2jmidid</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even then, the connection diagram looks a mess:

      <h2> TiMidity plus Jack Rack </h2>
    <p>
      In the chapter on 
      <a href="../Timidity/"> Karaoke TiMidity </a>
      we used TiMidity with a Jack backend and an
      Xaw interface to give a basic Karaoke system.
      We can now improve on that by using Jack Rack
      effects:
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Run TiMidity with Jack output, an Xaw interface
	  and synchronising the lyrics to sound by
	  <pre>
	    <code>
timidity -ia -B2,8 -Oj -EFverb=0 --trace --trace-text-meta
	    </code>
	  </pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Run Jack rack with TAP reverberator and a volume
	  control installed
	</li>
	<li>
	  Connect ports using <code>qjackctl</code>
	</li>
      </ul>
<p>
      The resulting system looks like
</p>
      <figure>
	<figcaption>TiMidity with Jack Rack</figcaption>
	<img src="timidity+jackrack.png" alt="TiMidity with Jack Rack"/>
      </figure>
    

    <h2> Customising TiMidity build </h2>
    <p>
      The version of TiMidity from the Ubuntu distro crashes if
      I try to dynamically load another interface. As the code is
      stripped, it is not possible to find out why.
      So to add a new interface we need to build TiMidity
      from source.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commands I now use are
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
./configure --enable-audio=alsa,jack \
            --enable-interface=xaw,gtk \
            --enable-server \
            --enable-dynamic
make clean
make
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
      An interface with key, say 'k', can then be run
      with Jack output by
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity -d. -ik -Oj --trace  --trace-text-meta 54154.mid
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Playing MP3+G with Jack Rack pitch shifting</h2>
    <p>
      The player <code>vlc</code> will play MP3+G files.
      Often the MP3+G is a zipped files containing both
      an MP3 file and CDG file with the same root. 
      This must be unzipped, and then can be played by giving
      <code>vlc</code> the MP3 filename:
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
vlc file.mp3
      </pre>
<p>
      This will pick up the CDG file and display the lyrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>vlc</code> can be used with Jack by the <code>--aout jack</code>
      option
</p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
vlc --aout jack file.mp3
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the common requests for <code>vlc</code> is to have
      a "pitch control" mechanism. While it should be possible to add
      LADPSA pitch controls to <code>vlc</code>, no-one has got
      around to it yet. But we can still add LADSPA effects
      through <code>jack-rack</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The steps are
</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  You may need to stop <code>pulseaudio</code> temporarily
	  by e.g <code>pasuspender cat</code>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Start the Jack daemon running as usual by
	  <pre class="sh_cpp">
jackd -d alsa
	  </pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Start <code>qjackctl</code> so you have some control
	  over Jack connections
	</li>
	<li>
	  Start <code>jack-rack</code>. Using the '+' button,
	  select Frequency -&gt; Pitch shifters -&gt; TAP Pitch Shifter.
	  Don't forget to Enable it, so it should look like
	
	  <figure>
	    <figcaption></figcaption>
	    <img src="jack-rack.png" alt="jack-rack"/>
	  </figure>
	  Note that in <code>qjackctl</code>, <code>jack-rack</code>
	  shows as <code>jack_rack</code> - the minus has been
	  replaced by an underscore, and is the proper Jack
	  name of <code>jack-rack</code>. Connect the output
	  of <code>jack-rack</code> to <code>system</code>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Now start <code>vlc --aout jack</code> so we can set up
	  the correct configuration. Choose Tools -&gt; Preferences,
	  and in "Show settings" set the radio button to "All".
	  Then under Audio -&gt; Output modules -&gt; Jack
	  check "Automatically connect to writable clients" 
	  and connect to clients matching "jack_rack"
	  (note the underscore). This should look like
	  <figure>
	    <figcaption></figcaption>
	    <img src="vlc-config.png" alt="VLC configuration"/>
	  </figure>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Next time you start <code>vlc</code> by e.g.
	  <code>vlc --aout jack BST.mp3</code>,
	  <code>qjackctl</code> should show
	  <figure>
	    <figcaption></figcaption>
	    <img src="qjackctl.png" alt="QJackCtl with VLC"/>
	  </figure>
	  and the music should play through <code>jack-rack</code>
	  where you can adjust the pitch.
	</li>
      </ul>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      The result of this with <code>vlc</code> playing MP3 audio
      through the pitch filter and also showing the CDG video
      should look like
    </p>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      This chapter has discussed a number of ways of building
      Jack pipelines to add effects to MIDI and MP3+G
      files.
