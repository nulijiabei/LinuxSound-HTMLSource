	Timidity is designed as a standalone application.
	To add to this, you should build a new "interface".
	It can also be subverted to act as though
	it were a library that can be called.
	This chapter explains both ways.

    </p>

    <h2> Timidity design </h2>
    <p>
      Timidty is designed as a standalone application.
      When built, you get a single executable but do not get
      a library of functions that can be called, unlike
      FluidSynth for example.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What you <em>can</em> do with Timidity is to add different interfaces.
      For example, there are ncurses, XaW and dumb interfaces which can be
      invoked at runtime by e.g.
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity -in ...
timidity -ia ...
timidity -id ...
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      There are also others with more specialised uses such as WRD, emacs,
      ALSA and remote interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the Xaw interface looks like
      <br/> <img alt ="" src="timidity-xaw.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea seems to be that if you want something extra, perhaps you should
      build a custom interface and drive it from Timidity.
    </p>

    <p>
      That doesn't always suit me, as I would prefer to be able to embed
      Timidity into my own applications in a simple way.
      The rest of this chapter looks at both ways:
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Turn TiMidity into a library and include it in your own code
	</li>
	<li>
	  Build your own interface
	</li>
      </ul>
    


    <h2> Making TiMidity into  a library </h2>
    <p>
      TiMidity is not designed as a library and you have to convince it 
      otherwise. That isn't hard, by messing around with the build system.
    </p>

    <h3> Managed environments hook </h3>
    <p>
      A system whereby the application is in control doesn't work so well in a
      managed environment such as Windows (or probably the many more recent
      ones such as Android). In such environments you can't call Timidity's
      <code>main</code>, but rather the <code>main</code> function belonging
      to the framework. This in turn will call an appropriate function
      in the application.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make use of such hooks, you need to download the source code of
      Timidity, either from a package manager or from the
      <a href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net/">
	TiMidity++
      </a> web site.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Timidity, the variations on the <code>main</code> function are in
      the file <code>timidity/timidity.c</code>. Controlled by various define's,
      you can have <code>main</code> or <code>win_main</code>. One of the more
      interesting defines is <code>ANOTHER_MAIN</code>. If this is defined,
      none of the versions of the <code>main</code> function are
      compiled and you end with main-free object modules.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you build Timidity from the toplevel source directory
      in the following way, it will produce an
      error that the <code>main</code> function is not defined:
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
CFLAGS="-DANOTHER_MAIN" ./configure
make
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      That's the hook you need to take Timidity from being a standalone
      application to being able to be called as a library from another
      application. Note that you <em>cannot</em> just remove
      <code>timidity/timidity.c</code> from the build - that file
      contains too many other critical functions!
    </p>

    <h3> Building the library </h3>
    <p>
      To build Timidity as a static library, remove the <code>main</code>
      function as above and attempt to build timidity.
      I found I needed to also specify which output system I wanted to use,
      such as ALSA:
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
CFLAGS="-DANOTHER_MAIN" ./configure --enable-audio=alsa
nake clean
make
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      This builds several <code>.ar</code> files and lots of object
      <code>.o</code> modules, but fails to build
      the final <code>timidity</code> executable as (of course) there
      is no <code>main</code> function. It also leaves a bunch of unlinked
      files in the <code>timidity</code> subdirectory.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can
      collect all of the object modules into an archive file by
      running this from the top of the TiMidity source directory:
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
ar cru  libtimidity.a */*.o
ranlib libtimidity.a
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      Since you will have to build Timidity from the source,
      check that it is working in normal mode before you try to
      build this alternative library version.
      That way you can find out that you need, say,
      the <code>libasound-dev</code> library in order to use
      ALSA, before you get mixed up in this other stuff!
    </p>


      <h3> Library entry points </h3>
    <p>
      Timidity built with <code>ANOTHER_MAIN</code> exposes these public entry points
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
void timidity_start_initialize(void);
int timidity_pre_load_configuration(void);
int timidity_post_load_configuration(void);
void timidity_init_player(void);
int timidity_play_main(int nfiles, char **files);
int got_a_configuration;
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      They do not seem to be defined in any convenient header file.
    </p>

    <h3> A minimal application </h3>
    <p>
      The real Timidity application is coded to work on many different
      operating systems with many different versions of libraries.
      Most of those dependencies are taken care of in building the
      object files and library as above.
    </p>


    <p>
      A minimal application just wraps our own <code>main</code>
      around the library entry points in <code>my_main.c</code>:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . my_main.c" -->
      </pre>
    <p>
      The compile command needs to bring in the Timidity library
      and any other required library, and is for an ALSA application
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
my_timidity: my_main.o
        gcc -g -o my_timidity my_main.o libtimidity.a  -lasound -lm
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <h3> Playing a background video to a MIDI file </h3>
    <p>
      As a more complex example, we look at playing a video file
      while also playing a MIDI file. We assume that the video
      file has no audio component and there is no attempt to
      perform any synchronisation between the two streams -
      that is an extra order of complexity!
    </p>

    <p>
      To play a video file we make use of the FFMpeg library
      to decode a video stream into video frames. We then
      need to display the frames in some kind of GUI object,
      and there are very, very many toolkits for doing this :-(.
      I've chosen the GTK toolkit as it underlies Gnome, is in
      C, supports many other things such as i18n and so on.
      I've based my code on 
      <a href="http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/">
	An ffmpeg and SDL Tutorial
      </a>
      by Stephen Dranger which uses the SDL toolkit for display.
    </p>

    <p>
      This runs the video and the MIDI in separate threads using the
      <code>pthreads</code> package. I've cheated a bit by hard-coding
      the names of the files and fixing the size of the video frames.
      It was a real b*mmer getting it to work under GTK3.0 as that
      has removed pixmaps and it took too, too long to find out what
      was going on.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've split the code into two files, one to play the video using Gtk
      and the other to play the TiMidity library and invoke the
      video. The video playing file is <code>video_code.c</code>:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . video_code.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      The file <code>video_player.c</code> is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . video_player.c" -->
      </pre>
    

   <h2> Building a new interface </h2>

    <h3> Shared objects </h3>
    <p>
      You can build your own interfaces and add them to TiMidity without
      changing or recompiling TiMidity. Such interfaces are built as
      dynamically loadable shared libraries, and are loaded when 
      TiMidity starts.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have to be a little careful with compile and link flags
      to build these libraries 
      (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7252550/loadable-bash-builtin">
	Building shared objects in Linux
      </a>). To build the shared object <code>if_my_interface.so</code>
      from <code>my_interface.c</code> I use
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
gcc  -fPIC $(CFLAGS) -c -o my_interface.o my_interface.c
gcc -shared -o if_my_interface.so my_interface.o
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      TiMidity will only load files that begin with <code>if_</code>.
      They can reside in any directory, with the default being
      something like <code>/usr/lib/timidity</code>
      or <code>/usr/local/lib/timidity</code>
      (see the "Supported dynamic load interfaces" directory
      from <code>timidity -h</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The defaulty directory to load dynamic modules can be overridden
      by the option <code>-d</code> as in
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity -d. -ik --trace 54154.mid
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <h3> Entry point </h3>
    <p>
      Each interface must have a unique function that can be called
      by the dynamic loader. Recall that interfaces are selected by the
      command line option <code>-i</code>, such as 
      <code>timidity -iT ...</code> to choose the VT100 interface.
      Your interface must have a single ASCII letter identifier
      which isn't used by any other interface, say <code>m</code>
      for "my interface". The loader will then look for a function
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
ControlMode *interface_m_loader(void)
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      where the "m" in the function name is the identifier.
      This function is simple: it just returns the address of a
      structure of type <code>ControlMode</code> which is defined
      elsewhere in the interface's code:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
ControlMode *interface_m_loader(void)
{
    return &amp;ctl;
}
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <h3> ControlMode </h3>
    <p>
      The <code>ControlMode</code> structure is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
typedef struct {
  char *id_name, id_character;
  char *id_short_name;
  int verbosity, trace_playing, opened;

  int32 flags;

  int  (*open)(int using_stdin, int using_stdout);
  void (*close)(void);
  int (*pass_playing_list)(int number_of_files, char *list_of_files[]);
  int  (*read)(int32 *valp);
  int  (*write)(char *buf, int32 size);
  int  (*cmsg)(int type, int verbosity_level, char *fmt, ...);
  void (*event)(CtlEvent *ev);  /* Control events */
} ControlMode;
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      which defines information about the interface and a set of functions
      which are called by TiMidity in response to events and actions
      within TiMidity. For example, for "my interface" this structure is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
ControlMode ctl=
    {
	"my interface", 'm',
	"my iface",
	1,          /* verbosity */
	0,          /* trace playing */
	0,          /* opened */
	0,          /* flags */
	ctl_open,
	ctl_close,
	pass_playing_list,
	ctl_read,
	NULL,       /* write */
	cmsg,
	ctl_event
    };
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      Some of these fields are obvious, some are less so:
      <dl>
	<dt>
	  <code>open</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This is called to set which files are used for I/O...
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code>close</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  ... and to close them
	</dd>
	<dt>
	   <code>pass_playing_list</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This function is passed a list of files to play.
	  The most likely action is to walk through this
	  list, calling <code>play_midi_file</code> on each
	</dd>
	<dt>
	   <code>read</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Not sure yet
	</dd>
	<dt>
	   <code>write</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Not sure yet
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code>cmsg</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Called with information messages
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code>event</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This is the major function for handling MIDI control events.
	  Typically it will be a big switch for each type of control
	  event
	</dd>
      </dl>
    <p>

    <h3> Include files </h3>
    <p>
      This is messy. A typical interface will need to know some of the
      constants and functions used by TiMidity. While these are organised
      logically for TiMidity, they are not organised conveniently for a
      new interface. So you have to keep pulling in extra includes, which point
      to other externals, which require more includes, etc. These may be in
      different directories such <code>timidity</code> and <code>utils</code>
      so you have to point to many different include directories.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that you will need the TiMidity source code to get these
      include files, downloaded from
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/timidity/?source=dlp">
        SourceForge TiMidity++
      </a>.

    </p>

      <h3> My simple interface </h3>
    <p>
      This basically does the same as the "dumb" interface
      built into TiMidity. It is loaded from the current directory
      and invoked by
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
timidity -im -d. 54154.mid
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      The code is in one file, <code>my_interface.c</code>:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . my_interface.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h3> Running my simple interface </h3>
    <p>
      When I tried to run the interface using the standard package
      TiMidity v2.13.2-40.1 it crashed in a memory free call.
      The code is stripped, so tracking down why is not easy
      and I haven't bothered to do so yet - I'm not sure what
      libraries, versions of code, etc, the package distro was 
      compiled against.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had built my own copy of TiMidity from source.
      This worked fine. Note that when you build TiMidity from
      source, you will need to specify that it can load dynamic
      modules, for example by
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
congfigure --enable-audio=alsa --enable-vt100 --enable-debug --enable-dynamic
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <h3> Playing a background video to a MIDI file </h3>
    <p>
      We can take the code from playing a video given earlier and put it
      as the "back end" of a TiMidity systems as a "video" interface.
      Essentially all that needs to be done is to change
      <code>ctl_open</code> from the simple interface to call
      the Gtk code to play the video, and change the identity
      of the interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new "video" interface is <code>video_player_interface.c</code>
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
      <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . video_player_interface.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      The build command is
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
video_code.o: video_code.c
        gcc  -fPIC $(CFLAGS) -c -o video_code.o video_code.c $(LIBS3)

if_video_player.so: video_player_interface.c video_code.o
        gcc  -fPIC $(CFLAGS) -c -o video_player_interface.o video_player_interface.c
        gcc -shared -o if_video_player.so video_player_interface.o video_code.o $(LIBS3)
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      You may hit a hiccup with running this Gtk-based interface: Gtk version
      mismatch :-(. The current builds of TiMidity either do not have the Gtk
      interface compiled in, or have Gtk version 2. If Gtk is not compiled in,
      you should have no problem. Otherwise, if you have compiled this interface
      with Gtk version 3, you will get runtime errors about type mismatches,
      inability to load widgets and no visual display.
    </p>

    <p>
      Check for Gtk in the executable by
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
nm timidity | grep gtk
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>
      Timidity is not designed for use by other applications.
      Either you add a new interface or work around the TiMidity
      design to produce a library.
      This chapter has shown both mechanisms and illustrated them
      with simple and more complex examples.
