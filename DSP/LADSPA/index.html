    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
      LADPSA is a set of plugins that may be used by applications.
      It is designed with simplicity in mind, so is only capable
      of a limited number of effects. Nevertheless, these can be
      quite wide-ranging and are sufficient for a large variety
      of applications.
    </p>

    <h2> User level tools </h2>
    <p>
      LADSPA plugins live in a directory defaulting to
      <code>/usr/lib/ladspa</code>. This can be controlled
      by the environment variable <code>LADSPA_PATH</code>.
      This directory will contain a set of <code>.so</code>
      files as LADSPA plugins. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Each plugin contains information
      about itself, and the set of plugins can be inspected by running the
      command line tool <code>listplugins</code>. By installing
      just LADPSA, the default plugins are
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
/usr/lib/ladspa/amp.so:
	Mono Amplifier (1048/amp_mono)
	Stereo Amplifier (1049/amp_stereo)
/usr/lib/ladspa/delay.so:
	Simple Delay Line (1043/delay_5s)
/usr/lib/ladspa/filter.so:
	Simple Low Pass Filter (1041/lpf)
	Simple High Pass Filter (1042/hpf)
/usr/lib/ladspa/sine.so:
	Sine Oscillator (Freq:audio, Amp:audio) (1044/sine_faaa)
	Sine Oscillator (Freq:audio, Amp:control) (1045/sine_faac)
	Sine Oscillator (Freq:control, Amp:audio) (1046/sine_fcaa)
	Sine Oscillator (Freq:control, Amp:control) (1047/sine_fcac)
/usr/lib/ladspa/noise.so:
	White Noise Source (1050/noise_white)
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      More detailed information about each plugin can be found from
      the tool <code>analyseplugin</code>. For example for the
      <code>amp</code> plugin,
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
$analyseplugin amp

Plugin Name: "Mono Amplifier"
Plugin Label: "amp_mono"
Plugin Unique ID: 1048

	"Input" input, audio
	"Output" output, audio

Plugin Name: "Stereo Amplifier"
Plugin Label: "amp_stereo"

	"Output (Left)" output, audio
	"Input (Right)" input, audio
	"Output (Right)" output, audio
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      A simple test of each plugin can be performed using
      <code>applyplugin</code>. When run with no arguments
      it gives a usage message:
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
$applyplugin 
Usage:	applyplugin [flags] &lt;input Wave file&gt; &lt;output Wave file&gt;
	&lt;LADSPA plugin file name&gt; &lt;plugin label&gt; &lt;Control1&gt; &lt;Control2&gt;...
	[&lt;LADSPA plugin file name&gt; &lt;plugin label&gt; &lt;Control1&gt; &lt;Control2&gt;...]...
Flags:	-s&lt;seconds&gt;  Add seconds of silence after end of input file.
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      This takes an input and an output WAV file as first and second parameters.
      The next ones are the names of the <code>.so</code> file
       and the plugin label chosen. This is followed by values of the
      controls. For the <code>amp</code> plugin, the file name is
      <code>amp.so</code>, the stereo plugin is <code>amp_stereo</code>
      and there is only one control for gain as a value between zero
      and one. To halve the volume of a file containing stereo WAV data,
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
applyplugin 54154.wav tmp.wav amp.so amp_stereo 0.5
	</code>
      </pre>
    

    <h2> The type LADSPA_Descriptor </h2>
    <p>
      Coomunication between an application and a LADSPA plugin
      takes place through a data structure of type
      <code>LADSPA_Descriptor</code>. This has fields that
      contain all of the information that is shown by
      <code>listplugins</code> and <code>analyseplugins</code>.
      In addition, it contains fields that control memory layout,
      whether or not it supports hard realtime, etc.
    </p>
      <dl>
	<dt>
	  <code> unsigned long UniqueID </code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Each plugin must have a unique ID within the LADSPA
	  system. 
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code> const char * Label  </code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This is the label used to refer to the plugin within the
	  LADSPA system
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code> const char * Name  </code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This is the "user friendly" name of the plugin.
	  For example, the <code>amp</code> file (shown later)
	  contains two plugins,
	  the mono amplifier has ID 1048,  label "amp_mono" and
	  name "Mono Amplifier", while the stereo amplifier has
	  ID 1049, label "amp_stereo" and name "Stereo Amplifier"
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code> const char * Maker, * Copyright </code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Obvious
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code> unsigned long PortCount </code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This indicates the number of ports (input AND output) present on
	  the plugin
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code> const LADSPA_PortDescriptor * PortDescriptors  </code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This member indicates an array of port descriptors. Valid indices
	  vary from 0 to PortCount-1
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code> const char * const * PortNames </code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This member indicates an array of null-terminated strings
	  describing ports. For example, the mono amplifer has two
	  input ports and one output port labelled
	  "Gain", "Input" and "Output". The Input port has 
	  PortDescriptor <code>(LADSPA_PORT_INPUT | LADSPA_PORT_AUDIO)</code>
	  while the Output port has 
	  PortDescriptor <code>(LADSPA_PORT_OUTPUT | LADSPA_PORT_AUDIO)</code>
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code> LADSPA_PortRangeHint * PortRangeHints  </code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This is an array of type <code>LADSPA_PortRangeHint</code>,
	  one element for each port. This allows the plugin to
	  pass information such as whether it has a value that
	  is bounded above or below, and if so what is that bound,
	  as to whether it should be treated as a Boolean value,
	  and so on. These hints could be used by, say, a GUI to
	  give a visual control display for the plugin.
	</dd>
      </dl>

    <p>
      Additionally, it contains fields that are function
      pointers, which are called by the LADSPA runtime to
      initialise the plugin, handle data and clean up.
      These fields are
    </p>
      <dl>
	<dt>
	  <code>instantiate</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This takes the sample rate as parameter.
	  It is responsible for general instantiation of the plugin,
	  setting local parameters, allocating memory, etc.
	  It returns a pointer to a plugin-specific data
	  structure containing all of the information
	  relating to that plugin. This pointer will be passed
	  as the first parameter to the other functions
	  so that they can retrieve information for this plugin.
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code>connect_port</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This takes three parameters, the second and third being
	  the port number and the address on which data will be
	  readable/writable respectively. The plugin is expected
	  to read/write data from the LADSPA runtime using this
	  address only for each port. it will be called before
	  <code>run</code> or <code>run_adding</code>.
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code>activate/deactivate</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  These may be called to re-initialise the plugin state.
	  They may be <code>NULL</code>.
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code>run</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  This function is where all of the plugin'a real work is done.
	  Its second parameter is the number of samples that are
	  ready to read/write.
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  <code>cleanup</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Obvious
	</dd>
      </dl>
    <p>
      Other function fields are normally set to <code>NULL</code>.
    </p>

    <h2> Loading a plugin </h2>
    <p>
      An application can load a plugin by calling
      <code>loadLADSPAPluginLibrary</code> with one
      parameter which is the name of the plugin file.
      Note that there is no LADSPA library - LADPSA
      suuplies a header file <code>ladspa.h</code> and
      the distribution may include a file 
      <code>load.c</code> which implements
      <code>loadLADSPAPluginLibrary</code>
      (it searches the directories in the <code>LADSPA_PATH</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      When a plugin is loaded by <code>dlopen</code>, 
      the function <code>_init</code>
      is called with no parameters. This may be used to setup
      the plugin and build, for example, the 
      <code>LADSPA_Descriptor</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A DLL must have an entry point that you can hook into.
      For LADSPA, each plugin must define a function
      <code>LADSPA_Descriptor * ladspa_descriptor(unsigned long Index)</code>.
      The values for indices 0, 1, ... are the 
      <code>LADSPA_Descriptor</code>'s for each of the plugins
      included in the file.
    </p>


    <h2> The amp program </h2>
    <p>
      The code for the <code>amp</code> program is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . amp.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> The analysePlugin client</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>analysePlugin</code> client loads
      a plugin file and then does a dump of all the information
      given about each plugin in the file. It is really
      just a long-winded plough through all the possibilities,
      printing out information. Its code is:     
    </p>
    <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl ladspa_sdk/src analyseplugin.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> A mono amplifier client </h2>
    <p>
      The <code>applyplugin</code> program shows how clients can use
      LADSPA plugins in a general way. Unfortunately, the
      necessary generality makes it harder to see what is being
      done. In this section we just look at a simple client
      that uses the <code>amp_mono</code> plugin to halve the
      volume of a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      From running <code>analyseplugin</code> on the
      <code>amp.so</code> file we can find that it contains
      a mono and stereo plugin. In the following program
      the <code>main</code> function loads the plugin file,
      gets a handle to the <code>ladspa_descriptor</code>
      structure and then looks through the descriptors until
      it finds the <code>amp_mono</code> plugin.
    </p>

    <p>
      We know there are three ports: control, input and output,
      so we look through the list of ports to assign indices
      and connect the relevant arrays to the plugin descriptor.
      The control port only needs the address of a
      float value which is the amount of amplification that
      will occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>run_plugin</code> function then just loops,
      reading samples from the imput file, applying the plugin
      and writing to the output file.
      I've used the <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">
	libsndfile</a> library to simplify reading and writing
      files in whatever format they are in.
      I've also used the <code>load.c</code> file from the
      LADSPA package to simplify loading the plugin library.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is <code>mono_amp.c</code>:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl mono_amp mono_amp.c" -->
      </pre>
    <p>
      it is run just by calling <code>mono_amp</code>, 
      no arguments.
    </p>

    <h2> A stereo amplifer with GUI </h2>
    <p>
      The <code>amp</code> file contains a stereo amplifier
      as well as a mono amplifier. This causes several differences
      to managing the plugin. there are now two input ports and
      two output ports, but still only one control port for the 
      amplification factor. We need an array of input ports
      and an array of output ports. This just adds a little
      complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The major difference is in handling the streams: 
      <code>libsndfile</code> returns <em>frames</em>
      of sound, with the two channels of a stereo signal
      interleaved. These have to be split out into separate
      channels for each input port, and then the two
      output ports have to interleaved back together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding a GUI such as GTK is fairly straightforward.
      The following code just shows a slider to control
      the volume. The GUI code and the LADSPA code must
      obviously run in different (POSIX) threads.
      There is really only one tricky point: the control
      value is not supposed to change during execution
      of the <code>run</code> function.
      This could be protected by locks, but in this case
      that is too heavyweight: just keep a copy of the
      control as modified by the slider, and bring that
      across before each call to <code>run</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is written to use GTK v3 and is:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl stereo_amp stereo_amp.c" -->
      </pre>
    <p>
      It is run just by calling <code>stereo_amp</code>, 
      no arguments.
    </p>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      LADSPA is a commonly used framework for audio effects plugins.
      This chapter has considered the programming model and
      also some command line tools.
