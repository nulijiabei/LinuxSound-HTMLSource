      <p>
	HTTP is the protocol underlying the Web. The protocol is agnostic to
	the content it carries - while it was originally designed to carry HTML documents
	it is now used to transport image files, Postscript documents, PowerPoint files
	and almost anything. This includes media files, the subject of this book.
      </p>

    <h2> HTTP servers </h2>
    <p>
      Content is delivered from a Web site by means of HTTP servers.
      The most well-known of these is Apache, but in the Linux world
      Nginx and Lighttpd are also common. There are a number of 
      proprietary servers as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      An HTTP server can deliver static files stored on the server,
      or construct content dynamically from e.g. a database connection.
    </p>

    <h2> HTTP clients </h2>

    <h3> HTTP Browsers </h3>
    <p>
      Point the browser to the URL of an audio file and it will pass
      the content to a helper which will attempt to play the file.
      The browser will choose the helper based on the file extension
      of the URL, or based on the Content-Type of the file as delivered
      in the HTTP header from the HTTP server.
    </p>

    <h3> mplayer </h3>
    <p>
      MPlayer is HTTP-aware:
      just give the URL of the file
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
mplayer http://localhost/audio/enigma/audio_01.ogg
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>


    <h3> VLC </h3>
    <p>
      VLC is also HTTP-aware:
      just give the URL of the file
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
vlc http://localhost/audio/enigma/audio_01.ogg
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <h2> Streaming vs downloading </h2>
    <p>
      If you download a file from the Web, then you can play it once it has finished
      downloading. This means that play is delayed until the entire file has been
      saved into the local file file system. On the other hand, since it is now local
      it can play without worrying about network delays. A simple shell script to 
      illustrate this is
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
wget -O tmp  http://localhost/audio/enigma/audio_01.ogg
mplayer tmp
rm tmp
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
    </p>

    <p>
      The alternative is to read the resource from the Web and hand it as it is
      received to a player, using some sort of pipeline. This is fine as long as the
      pipeline is large enough to buffer enough of the resource that it can cope
      with network delays. It is illustrated by
</p>
      <pre>
	<code>
wget -O -  http://localhost/audio/enigma/audio_01.ogg | mplayer -
	</code>
      </pre>
<p>
      (Yes, I know, mplayer can stream URLs directly - I'm using this way it for the point
      I'm making.).
