	This chapter looks at the user-level tools that are typical
	under  a Linux system, including players, various sound
	manipulation tools and editors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2> Players </h2>

    <h3> Mplayer </h3>
    <p>
      I think mplayer is fantastic and probably use it more than any other player.
      I usually run it from the command line but there are GUI versions available.
      It will play almost any media type, video as well as audio. I use it for
      both.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man page for mplayer is
      <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html">
	MPlayer
      </a>
      and the reference page is
      <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/index.html">
	MPlayer - The Movie Player
      </a>
    </p>

    <h3> VLC </h3>
    <p>
      VLC is my second favourite.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its main page is 
      <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">
	VideoLAN
      </a>
      and some documentation is at
      <a href="http://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Documentation">
	Welcome to VideoLAN's Documentation
      </a>
    </p>

    <h3> Totem </h3>
  
    <p>
      Very commonly used
    </p>
  

    <h2> Sound tools </h2>

    <h3> sox </h3>
    <p>
      SoX is the Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Its home page is 
      <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">
	SoX - Sound eXchange
      </a>
    </p>

    <h3> FFmpeg/avconv </h3>
    <p>
      ffmpeg is generally used as a converter from one format to another.
      There is a nice series of tutorials at
      <a href="http://linuxers.org/tutorial/ffmpeg-tutorial-beginners">
	A FFmpeg Tutorial For Beginners
      </a> by shredder12
    </p>

    <p>
      It can also be used to record from ALSA devices such as hw:0 or the default device.
      Recording from hw:0 can be done by
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 test.mp3
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      and from the default ALSA input by
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
ffmpeg -f alsa -i default test.mp3
	</code>
      </pre>

    <p>
      There was a fork some years ago of ffmpeg to give avconv.
      avconv is the default on Ubuntu systems. There are
      some differences between the two, not enough to
      justify the nuisance factor to us users.
    </p>




    <h3> GStreamer </h3>
    <p>
      GStreamer allows you to build "pipelines" that can be played using
      <code>gst-launch</code>.
      For example, to play an MP3 file using ALSA you would have the pipeline
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
gst-launch filesrc location="concept.mp3" ! decodebin ! alsasink
	</code>
      </pre>

    <p>
      The pipelines can do more complex tasks such as format conversion, mixing, etc.
      A tutorial is
      <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-gstreamer.html?ca=dgr-lnxw07GStreamer">
	Multipurpose multimedia processing with GStreamer
      </a> by Maciej Katafiasz
    </p>

    <p>
      It can also play MIDI files by e.g.
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
gst-launch filesrc location="rehab.mid" ! decodebin ! alsasink
	</code>
      </pre>

    <h2> Recorders, editors, etc </h2>

    <h3> Audacity </h3>
    <p>
      "Audacity is a free, easy-to-use and multilingual audio editor and recorder 
      for Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux and other operating systems"
      This is a fantastic tool and well worth using.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Its home page is
      <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net">

      </a>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      This short chapter has looked at some of the user level
      tools available under Linux. While we have listed several 
      of the major tools, a casual search will turn up far more.
