    <h2> Session management issues </h2>
    <p>
      Whenever there are multiple modules linked in some way, there can be a need to 
      manage the modules and their linkages. These arise quite quickly in the Jack
      environment, which is designed for multiple linkages.
      It doesn't take a very complex arrangement of Jack modules for management to become tedious.
      For example, consider the mixer session of the previous chapter:
      <br/><img alt="" src="mixer.png"/><br/>
      To set this up from the beginning requires
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Start <code>jackd</code> and <code>qjackctl</code>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Start <code>jack_mixer</code>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Open up two new sets of input ports on the mixer
	</li>
	<li>
	  Connect the MAIN mixer output ports to the playback ports
	</li>
	<li>
	  Connect the microphone ports to one set of mixer input ports
	</li>
	<li>
	  Start <code>mplayer</code>, which automatically connects to the playback ports
	</li>
	<li>
	  Disconnect the <code>mplayer</code> output ports from the playback ports
	  and reconnect them to the other set of mixer input ports
	</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      You don't want to do this every time you play a song!
    </p>

    <p>
      The LADISH session manager identifies 
      <a href="http://ladish.org/wiki/levels">
	different levels of control of applications by session managers.
      </a>
      Removing the explicit references to particular managers and frameworks, they are:
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  level 0 - an application is not linked to a session handling library. 
	  User has to save application projects manually or rely on autosave support from application.
	</li>
	<li>
	  level 1 - an application is not linked to a session handling library. 
	  Application saves when particular messages or signals are received.
	</li>
	<li>
	  level 2, an application is linked to a session management library. 
	  Limited interaction with session handler because of limitations in the session manager
	</li>
	<li>
	  level 3 - an application is linked to a sophisticated session manager. 
	  Full interaction with the session handler 
	</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      As <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/533594">
	Dave Phillips
      </a> points out, "The use of these levels is an attempt to sort and regulate the various 
      possible conditions for any Linux audio application. 
      Those conditions include the degree of JACK compliance, 
      any WINE or DOS requirements, network operation, the multiplicity of existing APIs, and so forth. "
    </p>

    <p>
      The current batch of session management frameworks
      used for Linux audio includes
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  LASH
	</li>
	<li>
	  Jack session management
	</li>
	<li>
	  LADISH
	</li>
	<li>
	  Non-session manager
	</li>
	<li>
	  Chino
	</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      The existence of multiple managers means that most applications will only support
      the protocols of only one or at most a few. If you choose a particular manager
      then you will be restricted to the applications you can run under its control.
    </p>

    <h2>jack_connect</h2>
    <p>
      The programs <code>jack_connect</code> and <code>jack_disconnect</code>
      canbe used to reconfigure connections between clients. For example,
      the MIDI player <code>TiMidity</code> will connect its output ports to the first
      available Jack input ports, which are generally the system ports connected
      to the sound card. If you wish to connect <code>TiMidity</code> to, say,
      <code>jack-rack</code> then its output ports have to be first disconnected
      and then connected to the correct ones. On the other hand,
      <code>jack-rack</code> does not connect to anything by default
      so may need to be connected to the system ports. This is done by e.g.
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
jack_disconnect TiMidity:port_1 system:playback_1
jack_disconnect TiMidity:port_2 system:playback_2

jack_connect TiMidity:port_1 jack_rack:in_1
jack_connect TiMidity:port_2 jack_rack:in_2

jack_connect jack_rack:out_1 system:playback_1
jack_connect jack_rack:out_2 system:playback_2
      </pre>
    

    <h2> LASH </h2>
    <p>
      This was the earliest successful session mananager for Linux audio but has since
      fallen out of use. It does not seem to be in the Ubuntu repositories any more.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the applications requiring LASH is  <code>jack_mixer</code>.
      Even worse, it uses the Python 
      <code>LASH</code> module from the <code>python-lash.2.7.4-0ubuntu</code> package.
      The only copy I can find requires
      a version of Python less than 2.7 and the installed  version of Python
      is 2.7.4. This is an application which at present will not benefit from
      current session management tools - while it might run 
      as Level 1 with LASH, it can only run at Level 0 with other session managers.
    </p>

    <p>
      So there are Jack applications which require LASH for session management
      but no such support seems to exist any more.
    </p>


    <h2> Jack sessions </h2>
    <p>
      A list of Jack session aware applications as at 2010 is at
      <a href="http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/jack_session">
	apps supporting jack-session 
      </a> and
      <a href="http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/categories/jack_session">
	Jack Session
      </a>
    <p>
      <code>qjackctl</code> has a session manager which will allow you to save and restore sessions.
      You save a session by clicking on the Session button and then choosing a session
      name and directory.
      It stores the session information as an XML file in whatever directory you save it. For the session above,
      this looks like
    </p>
      <pre>
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . qjackctl-session.xml" -->
      </pre>
   
    
    <p>
      On loading the session, it looks like
      <br/><img alt="" src="qjackctl-session.png"/><br/>
      There are many red crosses - restoring a session doesn't start these particular
      applications. If you re-start <code>jack_mixer</code> by hand, 
      then it establishes the links
      between its MAIN output ports and system playback ports, and several of the red crosses
      disappear. But it doesn't create the extra ports that we created earlier.
      We need to repeat the work of creating new input ports with the right names
      and then <code>qjackctl</code> does re-establish the connections, and more red
      crosses disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we run <code>mplayer</code> again, it just establishes its own default
      connections to the playback ports and has to be re-mapped by hand.
      It doesn't even seem to meet Level 0, as <code>qjackctl</code>
      doesn't remap its connections automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      The issue here is that the <code>mplayer</code> and <code>jack_mixer</code>
      do not talk the Jack session management protocol.
      The session manager does reset
      any connections made by some applications, but not all of them.
      An example is given later of adding Jack session management to an
      application and then it will be restarted and reconnected properly.
    </p>

    <h2> LADISH </h2>
    <p>
      LADISH is designed as the successor to LASH and is available in the repositories.
    </p>

    <p>
      LADISH can start, stop and configure sessions. In particular, it can setup
      different Jack configurations. This means that you do not start Jack and then
      start LADISH, but the other way around: start the GUI tool <code>gladish</code>,
      configure Jack and then start a session.
      The process is described in the
      <a href="http://ladish.org/wiki/tutorial">
	LADI Session Handler
      </a> Wiki - follow it, in particular connecting Jack to, say, ALSA.
      Otherwise you will get no sound!
      See also
      <a href="http://www.penguinproducer.com/Blog/2011/12/the-ladi-session-handler/">
	The LADI Session Handler
      </a> by the Penguin Producer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once set up, start a new Studio and then start applications from its
      Applications menu. To run <code>mplayer</code> you need to give the full
      command such as
    </p>
      <pre>
	<code>
	  mplayer -ao jack 54154.mp3
	</code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      You can start <code>jack_mixer</code> from the Applications menu
      and then add two new sets of input ports, as in the Jack chapter.
      After reconnecting them, you end with a connection graph like
      <br/><img alt="" src="ladish-session.png"/><br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Connection graphs are stored as an XML file in <code>$HOME/.ladish</code>.
      For example, the above graph is stored as
    </p>
      <pre>
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . ladish-session.xml" -->
      </pre>
    <p>
      The full command to restart <code>mplayer</code> is stored in this file,
      as are all the connections made.
    </p>

    <p>
      On stopping and restarting a session, <code>mplayer</code> is started
      with the same MP3 file, but has the default connections. 
      It ignores the connections of the LADISH session.
      Similarly, <code>jack_mixer</code> is restarted, but the 
      additional ports have to be recreated by hand - this is not a LADISH
      aware application so it runs at Level 0.
      However, once created, the LADISH reconnections are made okay.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the user's viewpoint, the difference between these session managers are
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Jack applications can be started in any manner and will be picked up
	  by the Jack session manager.
	  However, any specific command-line parameters will be lost
	</li>
	<li>
	  Applications need to be started by the LADISH session manager in
	  order to be managed by it.
	  However, it can record command line parameters and restart the
	  application using them
	</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      From the developer's viewpoint (see later), the difference between these session managers are
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Jack session aware applications can be started in any manner 
	  and will encode the command line required to restart them
	  in the program
	</li>
	<li>

	</li>
      </ul>

      </a> at trac.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applications that can be managed by Jack Sessions (JS) may be JS aware at Level 1
      or JS unaware. For the unaware ones, the best that can be done is for the session
      manager to maybe start and stop them. For the JS aware applications, they must
      be set up to
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Register with a JS manager
	</li>
	<li>
	  Respond to messages from the JS manager
	</li>
	<li>
	  Be startable with session information
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      Response to a JS message will generally
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Save the application's state into a file,
	  where the directory is given by the session manager
	</li>
	<li>
	  Reply to the session manager with a command that can be used to restart
	  the application, with enough information that it can restore its state
	  (typically the name of the file in which it stored its state information)
	</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      JS aware clients identify themselves to the session manager by a UUID 
      (unique universal identifier). It doesn't seem to matter what this is
      or how it is generated: the client application just makes it up as 
      long as it is an integer represented as a string.
      This is passed to the session manager when registering, but should
      also be passed back to the client when it is restarted by the
      session manager. This is done by a command line argument
      to the application, and the format of the command line is also
      up to the client.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple case might be two options <code>-u</code> for UUID and
      <code>-f</code> for saved state file. This would be parsed 
      using <code>getopt</code> by
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int c;
  char *file = NULL;
  char *uuid = "13";
  while ((c = getopt (argc, argv, "f:u:")) != -1)
    switch (c) {
      case 'u':
        uuid = optarg;
        break;
      case 'f':
        file = optarg;
        break;
      ...
    }
  }    
  ...
}
      </pre>
   

    <p>
      The application could then restore its state using the information
      it has previously stored in the state file, and then
      register again with a session manager by
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
jack_client *client;
client = jack_client_open("myapp", JackSessionID, NULL, uuid);
jack_set_session_callback(client, session_callback, NULL); 
      </pre>
   

    
    <p>
      The callback function <code>session_callback</code> is invoked whenever
      the session manager needs to communicate with the application. It takes
      a <code>jack_session_event</code> and whatever was passed as the
      last argument to <code>jack_set_session_callback</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The job of the callback is then to save state information,
      pass information back to the session manager and perhaps exit
      (from <a href="http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/Dev/JackSession">
	trac - the session API</a>):
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
int session_callback(jack_session_event_t *ev) {
  char filename[256];
  char command[256];

  snprintf(filename, sizeof(filename), "%smyfile.state", ev->session_dir);
  snprintf(command,  sizeof(command),  
           "my_app -u %s -f ${SESSION_DIR}myfile.state", ev->client_uuid);
  your_save_function(filename);
  ev-&gt;command_line = strdup(command);
  jack_session_reply(jack_client, ev);
  if(ev-&gt;type == JackSessionSaveAndQuit)
      quit();
  jack_session_event_free(ev);
  return 0;
}
     </pre>
    <p>
      <a href="http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/Dev/JackSession">
	trac</a> suggests that if this is run in a
      multi-threaded environment such as GTK, it should be run when other
      threads are idle e.g. by <code>g_idel_add</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      WE can illustrate this with the <code>delay</code> program from the
      Jack chapter. Adding in the extra code gives a revised <code>delay.c</code>.
      I have enclosed the extra code with <code>#ifdef JACK_SESSION</code>
      for ease in seeing the changes.
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">

    <h2> LADISH API </h2>
    <p>
      If an application is Jack session aware, then the LADISH GUI tool
      <code>gladish</code> can manage the applicaiton as a Level 1
      application. In other words, <code>gladish</code> can manage
      Jack session and LADISH clients equally.
      In that sense, there is no need to additionally add LADISH
      awareness to an application unless you prefer the LADISH
      way of managing sessions.
