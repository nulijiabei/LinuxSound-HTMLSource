      <p>
	This chapter has nothing to do with sound.
	However, many sound applications use a GUI environment
	playing a video (or similar), possibly with text overlays
	such as subtitles.
	This diversion is about programming the video side of this,
	using FFMpeg, Gtk, Cairo and Pango.
	I assume that you are familiar with the concepts of
	widgets, events and event handlers and so on that underlie all
	current GUI frameworks.

    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
      Videos often accompany audio. Karaoke oftens overlays the video
      with lyrics. Building an application to include video as well
      as audio takes us into the realm of graphical user interfaces
      (GUIs). This is a complex area in its own right, and deserves
      (and has!) many books, including my own from many years back on
      the X Window System and Motif.
    </p>

    <p>
      Motif lost its status as a major GUI for Linux/Unix systems
      a long time ago. There are many alternatives now, including
      Gtk (Gimp toolkit), tcl/Tk, Java Swing, KDE, XFCE, ...
      They each have their own adherents, domains of use, quirks,
      idiosyncrasies, ... No single GUI will satisfy everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter I deal with Gtk. The reasons are threefold:
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  It has a C library. It also has a Python library which
	  is nice and I might use it one day. Most importantly it
	  is <em>not</em> C++ based - C++ is one of my least 
	  favourite languages. I once came across a quote (source
	  lost) that "C++ is a laboratory experiment that escaped"
	  and I completely agree with that assessment
	</li>
	<li>
	  It has good support for i18n (internationalisation).
	  I want to be able to play Chinese Karaoke files, so this
	  is important to me
	</li>
	<li>
	  It is not Java-based. Don't get me wrong, I really like Java
	  and have been programming in it for years.
	  The MIDI API is pretty good, and of course everything
	  else such as i18n is great. But for MIDI it is a CPU
	  hog and is unusable on low powered devices such as the
	  Raspberry Pi, and generally the audio/video API has not
	  progressed in years
	</li>
      </ul>


    <p>
      Nevertheless, as I struggled to get my head around Gtk,
      versions 2.0 versus 3.0, Cairo, Pango, Glib, etc.
      I thought it might have been easier just to fix the Java
      MIDI engine! This was not a pleasant experience,
      as the sequel will show :-(.
    </p>

    <h2> FFMpeg </h2>
    <p>
      To play Mpeg files, OGV files or similar, a decoder is
      required. The main contenders seem to be GStreamer and 
      FFMpeg. For no particular reason I chose FFMpeg.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following program reads from a video file and stores
      the first five frames to disk. It is taken directly
      from 
      <a href="http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/">
	An ffmpeg and SDL Tutorial
      </a> by Stephen Dranger.
      The program is <code>play_video.c</code>:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . play_video.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Basic Gtk </h2>
    <p>
      Gtk is a fairly standard GUI toolkit. Simple programs
      are described in many tutorials such as
      <a href="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/gtktutorial/firstprograms/">
	First programs in GTK+
      </a>
      Refer to such tutorials for the basics in Gtk programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      We just include the following example without explanation
      which uses three child widgets, two buttons and one label. 
      The label will hold an integer number. 
      The buttons will increase or decrease this number. 
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	#include &lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;

	gint count = 0;
	char buf[5];

	void increase(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer label)
	{
  	    count++;

	    sprintf(buf, "%d", count);
	    gtk_label_set_text(GTK_LABEL(label), buf);
	}

	void decrease(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer label)
	{
	    count--;

	    sprintf(buf, "%d", count);
	    gtk_label_set_text(GTK_LABEL(label), buf);
	}

	int main(int argc, char** argv) {

	    GtkWidget *label;
	    GtkWidget *window;
	    GtkWidget *frame;
	    GtkWidget *plus;
	    GtkWidget *minus;

	    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);

	    window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
	    gtk_window_set_position(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER);
	    gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 250, 180);
	    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "+-");

	    frame = gtk_fixed_new();
	    gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), frame);

	    plus = gtk_button_new_with_label("+");
	    gtk_widget_set_size_request(plus, 80, 35);
	    gtk_fixed_put(GTK_FIXED(frame), plus, 50, 20);

	    minus = gtk_button_new_with_label("-");
	    gtk_widget_set_size_request(minus, 80, 35);
	    gtk_fixed_put(GTK_FIXED(frame), minus, 50, 80);

	    label = gtk_label_new("0");
	    gtk_fixed_put(GTK_FIXED(frame), label, 190, 58); 

	    gtk_widget_show_all(window);

	    g_signal_connect(window, "destroy",
	    G_CALLBACK (gtk_main_quit), NULL);

	    g_signal_connect(plus, "clicked", 
	    G_CALLBACK(increase), label);

	    g_signal_connect(minus, "clicked", 
	    G_CALLBACK(decrease), label);

	    gtk_main();

	    return 0;
	}
      </pre>


    <p>
      Gtk, like every other GUI toolkit, has a large number of widgets.
      These are listed in the
      <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/">
	GTK+ 3 Reference Manual
      </a>.
      This includes the widget
      <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/GtkImage.html">
	GtkImage
      </a>.
      As would be expected from the name, it can take a set of pixels from somewhere
      and build them into an image which can be displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following example is from
      <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xy/cs23/gtk.html">
	CS 23 Software Design and Implementation Lecture notes GTK+ Programming
      </a>
      and shows an image loaded from a file:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
#include &lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;

int main( int argc, char *argv[])
{
	GtkWidget *window, *image;

	gtk_init(&argc, &argv);

	window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);

	gtk_window_set_position(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER);
	gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 230, 150);
	gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "Image");
	gtk_window_set_resizable(GTK_WINDOW(window), FALSE);

	gtk_container_set_border_width(GTK_CONTAINER(window), 2);

	image = gtk_image_new_from_file("pic/60cm.gif");
	gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), image);

	g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(window), "destroy", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);
	gtk_widget_show_all(window);
	gtk_main();

	return 0;
}
      </pre>    


    <h2> Versions of Gtk  </h2>
    <p>
      Gtk currently (at July 2013) has major versions 2 and 3.
      The macro <code>GTK_MAJOR_VERSION</code> can be used to detect
      version 2 or 3. However, Gtk also depends on a number of other libraries
      and it can  get very confusing working out which documentation pages
      you should be looking at. Here is a list of the
      principal libraries and their primary

    <h2> Displaying the video using Gtk </h2>

    <p>
      We want to take the images produced by FFMpeg as
      <code>AVFrame</code>'s and display them in a
      <code>GtkImage</code>. We don't want to use code that
      reads from a file, because reading and writing files at 30 frames
      per second would be ludicrous. Instead we want some in-memory
      representation of the frames to load into the <code>GtkImage</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is where we hit our first snag: the suitable in-memory
      representation changed in an incompatable way between Gtk 2.0 and
      Gtk 3.0.
      I'm only going to talk in the language of the X Window System
      since I don't know about other underlying systems such as
      Microsoft Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
      See
      <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.5/gtk-migrating-2-to-3.html">
	Migrating from GTK+ 2.x to GTK+ 3
      </a> for a description of some of the changes between these versions.
      
      <h3> Pixmaps </h3>
    <p>
      The X Window System architecture model is a client-server model which
      has clients (applications) talking to servers (devices with graphic
      displays and input devices). At the lowest level (Xlib) a client
      will send basic requests such as "draw a line from here to there"
      to the server. The server will draw the line using information on
      the server side such as current line thickness, colour, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to keep an array of pixels to represent an image, then
      this array is usually kept on the <em>X Window server</em> in a
      <em>pixmap</em>. Pixmaps can be created and modified by applications
      by sending messages across the wire from the client to the server.
      Even a simple modification such as changing the value of a single
      pixel involves a network roundtrip and this can obviously become
      very expensive if done often.
    </p>

    <h3> Pixbufs </h3>
    <p>
      Pixbufs are <em>client</em> side equivalents of pixmaps.
      They can be manipulated by the client without round trips
      to the X server. This reduces time and network overheads in
      manipulating them. However, it means that information that would
      have been kept on the server now has to built and maintained on the
      client application side.
    </p>

    <h3> X, Wayland and Mir </h3>
    <p>
      The X Window System is nearly 30 years old. During that time it has
      evolved to meet changes in hardware and in software requirements,
      while still maintaining backward compatability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Significant changes have occurred in hardware during this 30 years:
      multi-core systems are now prevalent and GPUs have brought changes
      in processing video. And generally the amount of memory (cache and RAM)
      means that memory is no longer such an issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, the software side has evolved.
      It is now common to make use of a "compositing window manager" such
      as Compiz so that you can have effects such as Wobbly Windows. This
      is not good for the X Window model: requests from the application go
      to the X server but then a requested image has to be passed to the
      compositing window manager which will perform its effects and then
      send images back to the X server. This is big increase in network
      traffic, in which the X server is now just playing the role of
      display rather than compositor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Application libraries have now evolved so that much of the work
      that was formerly done by the X server can now be done on the
      application side by libraries such as cairo, pixman, freetype, fontconfig
      and pango.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of these changes have led to proposals for new backend
      servers which live cooperatively in this evolved world.
      This has been sparked by the development of 
      <a href="http://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>,
      but is a bit messed up by Ubuntu forking this to develop
      <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mir/">Mir</a>. 
      We won't buy into those arguments - just google for
      "mir and wayland"...
    </p>

    <p>
      In a very simplistic sense, what it means here is that
      in future pixmaps are out while pixbufs are in.
    </p>

    <h3> Gtk 3.0 </h3>
    <p>
      With Gtk 3.0, pixmaps no longer exist. You only have pixbufs,
      in the data structure <code>GdkPixbuf</code>. To display the 
      FFMpeg decoded video we pick up after the image has been
      transcoded to the <code>picture_RGB</code>, translate it into
      a <code>GdkPixbuf</code> and create the <code>GtkImage</code>
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data(picture_RGB->data[0], GDK_COLORSPACE_RGB,
	                                  0, 8, width, height, 
	                                  picture_RGB->linesize[0], 
                                          pixmap_destroy_notify,
	                                  NULL);
	gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf((GtkImage*) image, pixbuf);
      </pre>
    
    <h3> Gtk 2.0 </h3>
    <p>
      Gtk 2.0 still had pixmaps, in the structure <code>GdkPixmap</code>.
      In theory it should be possible to have code similar to the Gtk 3.0
      code using the function
      <code>GdkPixmap *gdk_pixmap_create_from_data(GdkDrawable *drawable,
	const gchar *data,
	gint width,
	gint height,
	gint depth,
	const GdkColor *fg,
	const GdkColor *bg)</code>
      which is documented in the GDK 2 Reference Manual at
      <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gdk/unstable/gdk-Bitmaps-and-Pixmaps.html#gdk-pixmap-create-from-data">
	Bitmaps and Pixmaps
      </a> and then call
      <code>void gtk_image_set_from_pixmap(GtkImage *image,
	GdkPixmap *pixmap,
	GdkBitmap *mask)</code>
      documented in the Gtk 2.6 reference manual at
      <a href="http://www.gtk.org/api/2.6/gtk/GtkImage.html#gtk-image-set-from-pixmap">
	GtkImage
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only problem is that I couldn't get the function 
      <code>gdk_pixmap_create_from_data</code> to work.
      No matter what argument I tried for the drawable,
      the call always barfed on either its type or its value.
      For example, a documented value is <code>NULL</code>
      but this always caused an assertion error
      ("should not be NULL").
    </p>

    <p>
      So what does work? Well, all I could find was a bit of a mess of
      both pixmaps <em>and</em> pixbufs: create a pixbuf filled with
      video data, create a pixmap, write the pixbuf data into the pixmap,
      and then fill the image with the pixmap data:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data(picture_RGB->data[0], GDK_COLORSPACE_RGB,
             	                          0, 8, width, height, 
	                                  picture_RGB->linesize[0], 
	                                  pixmap_destroy_notify,
	                                  NULL);
	pixmap = gdk_pixmap_new(window->window, width, height, -1);
	gdk_draw_pixbuf((GdkDrawable *) pixmap, NULL,
	                pixbuf, 
	                0, 0, 0, 0, wifth, height,
	                GDK_RGB_DITHER_NORMAL, 0, 0);

	gtk_image_set_from_pixmap((GtkImage*) image, pixmap, NULL);
      </pre>


    <h3> Threads and Gtk </h3>
    <p>
      The video will need to play in its own thread. Gtk will set up a 
      GUI processing loop in its thread. Since this is Linux, we will
      use Posix <code>pthreads</code>. The video thread will need to
      be started explicitly by
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	pthread_t tid;
	pthread_create(&tid, NULL, play_background, NULL);
      </pre>
    <p>
      where the function <code>play_background</code> calls the
      FFMpeg code to decode the video file.
      Note that the thread should not be started until the
      application has been realised, or it will attempt to draw
      into non-existent windows.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Gtk thread will be started by the call to
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	gtk_widget_show (window);
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      That's straightforward enough. But now we have to handle
      the video thread making calls into the GUI thread in order
      to draw the image. The best document I have found on this
      is <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk-faq/stable/x481.html">
	Is GTK+ thread safe? How do I write multi-threaded GTK+ applications?
      </a>
      Basically it states that code which can affect the Gtk thread should
      be enclosed by a <code>gdk_threads_enter() ... gdk_threads_leave()</code>
      pair.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's okay for Gtk 2.0. What about Gtk 3.0? Ooops!
      Those calls are now deprecated. So what are you supposed
      to do? So far (as at 3 July, 2013) all that seems to exist
      are developer dialogs such as
      <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2012-August/msg00020.html">
	Re: deprecating gdk threads
      </a> which states "We have never done a great job of explaining when
      gdk_threads_enter/leave are required, it seems - as a consequence, a
      good number of the critical sections I've seen marked throughout my
      jhbuild checkout are unnecessary. If your application doesn't call
      gdk_threads_init or gdk_threads_set_lock_functions, there's no need to
      use enter/leave. Libraries are a different story, of course".
      But who should call <code>gdk_threads_init</code>? And what's this
      about libraries? I'll continue to use them until I know better.

    <h3> The code </h3>
    <p>
      Finally, the code to play a video in a Gtk application which
      works with both Gtk 2.0 and Gtk 3.0! It is
      <code>gtk_play_video.c</code>:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . gtk_play_video.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Overlaying an image on top of an image </h2>
    <p>
      It is common in a movie on TV to see a fixed image layered
      on top of the video. Subtitles can be an example of dynamic
      images but may be text overlaid instead. This section just 
      considers one image on top of another.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Gtk 2.0 it is surprisingly easy: draw one pixbuf into a
      pixmap and then draw the overlay pixbuf into the same pixmap.
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
pixmap = gdk_pixmap_new(window->window, 720, 480, -1);
	
gdk_draw_pixbuf((GdkDrawable *) pixmap, NULL,
		pixbuf, 
		0, 0, 0, 0, 720, 480,
		GDK_RGB_DITHER_NORMAL, 0, 0);

// overlay another pixbuf
gdk_draw_pixbuf((GdkDrawable *) pixmap, NULL,
                overlay_pixbuf, 
                0, 0, 0, 0, overlay_width, overlay_height,
                GDK_RGB_DITHER_NORMAL, 0, 0);

gtk_image_set_from_pixmap((GtkImage*) image, pixmap, NULL);

gtk_widget_queue_draw(image);
      </pre>


    <p>
      Gtk 3.0 does not seem so straightforward as pixmaps have disappeared.
      Various pages suggest using Cairo surfaces instead and later sections
      will look at that. But the page on the
      <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gdk-pixbuf/unstable/gdk-pixbuf-The-GdkPixbuf-Structure.html">
	The GdkPixbuf Structure
      </a>
      suggests that - as long as you get the data types aligned - you
      can just write the pixels of the second image into the pixbuf
      data of the first. The page (although old)
      <a href="http://openbooks.sourceforge.net/books/wga/graphics-gdk-pixbuf.html">
	Gdk-pixbuf
      </a> is a useful tutorial on Gdk pixbufs.
      One of the details you have to get right is the
      <em>rowstride</em> of each image: the two-dimensional image 
      is stored as a linear array of bytes and the rowstride tells how
      many bytes make up a row. Typically there are 3 or 4 bytes per
      pixel (for RGB or RGB+alpha) and these also need to be matched between
      the images.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program <code>gtk_play_video_overlay.c</code> is
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . gtk_play_video_overlay.c" -->
      </pre>


    <h2> Alpha channel </h2>
    <p>
      An overlay image may have some "transparent" parts in it. You don't want
      such parts to be overlaid onto the underlying image. But such parts will
      need to have a value in the array of pixels. Even zero is a value - black!
      Some images will have another byte per pixel allocated as the
      "alpha channel". This has a value to show how "transparent" the pixel is.
      A value of 255 means not transparent at all, a value of zero means totally
      transparent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest way of combining a "transparent" pixel with the underlying
      pixel is simply to not do so: leave the underlying pixel untouched.
      More complex algorithms are pointed to by the Wikipedia
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">
	Alpha compositing
      </a> page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Converting an image which doesn't have an alpha channel to one which
      does can be done using the function <code>gdk_pixbuf_add_alpha</code>.
      This can also be used to set the value of the alpha channel by
      matching against a colour. For example, the following should set the
      alpha value to 0 for any white pixels and to 255 for all others:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_add_alpha(pixbuf, TRUE, 255, 255, 255);
      </pre>

    <p>
      Unfortunately it seems to want to leave an "edge" of pixels which
      should be marked as transparent.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      With alpha marking in place, a simple test can be used in the overlay 
      function as to whether or not to perform the overlay:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<code>
if (alpha &lt; 128) {
    continue;
 }
	</code>
      </pre>


    <p>
      It's not worth giving a complete program just for a couple 
      of changed lines. It is
      <a href="gtk_play_video_overlay_alpha.c">gtk_play_video_overlay_alpha.c</a>.
    </p>

    <h2> Using Cairo to draw on an image </h2>
    <p>
      With the disappearance of pixmaps from Gtk 3.0, Cairo is now the
      only real way of assembling multiple components into an image.
      General Cairo information is at
      <a href="http://cairographics.org/documentation/">
	Cairo documentation
      </a>,
      a tutorial is at
      <a href="http://zetcode.com/gfx/cairo/">
	Cairo graphics tutorial
      </a>
      and information about overlaying onto images is at
      <a href="http://zetcode.com/gfx/cairo/cairoimages/">
	Images in Cairo
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cairo takes sources and a destination. The sources can be changed,
      and frequently are: from an image source, to a colour source, etc.
      The destination is where the drawn stuff ends up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Destinations can be in memory or at a variety of backends.
      We want in an in-memory destination so that we can extract
      a pixbuf from it, with all operations done on the client side.
      We create a destination as a <em>surface</em> 
      of type <code>cairo_surface_t</code>
      and set it into a <em>Cairo context</em> of type<code>cairo_t</code>
      by
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
cairo_surface_t *surface = cairo_image_surface_create (CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32, 
						       width, height);
cairo_t *cr = cairo_create(surface);
      </pre>

    <p>
      The cairo context <code>cr</code> is then used to set sources, perform drawing, etc.
      At the end of this we will extract a pixmap from the <code>surface</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first step is to set the source to the pixbuf for each frame
      of the video and to <code>paint</code> this to the destination by
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
gdk_cairo_set_source_pixbuf(cr, pixbuf, 0, 0);
cairo_paint (cr);
      </pre>
    


    <p>
      We can overlay another image on top of this by changing the source
      to the overlay image and painting that:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
gdk_cairo_set_source_pixbuf(cr, overlay_pixbuf, 300, 200);
cairo_paint (cr);
      </pre>
    <p>
      Note that Cairo will do any alpha blending that is required if
      the overlay has "transparent" pixels.
    </p>
    <p>
      To draw the text, we need to reset the source to an RGB surface,
      set all the parameters for the text, and draw the text
      into the
      destination. This is done by
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
// white text
cairo_set_source_rgb(cr, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0); 
// this is a standard font for Cairo 
cairo_select_font_face (cr, "cairo:serif",
			CAIRO_FONT_SLANT_NORMAL, 
			CAIRO_FONT_WEIGHT_BOLD);
cairo_set_font_size (cr, 20);
cairo_move_to(cr, 10.0, 50.0);
cairo_show_text (cr, "hello");
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      Finally we want to extract the fnal image from the destination and set 
      it into the <code>GdkImage</code> for display. Here there is another
      difference between Gtk 2.0 and Gtk 3.0: Gtk 3.0 has a function
      <code>gdk_pixbuf_get_from_surface</code> which will return a
      <code>GdKPixbuf</code>; Gtk 2.0 has no such function.
      We only look at the Gtk 3.0 version for now
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_get_from_surface(surface,
				     0,
				     0,
				     width,
				     height);

gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf((GtkImage*) image, pixbuf); 
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      The complete program is <code>gtk_play_video_cairo.c</code>
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . gtk_play_video_cairo.c" -->
      </pre>
    

    <h2> Drawing text using Pango </h2>
    <p>
      While Cairo can draw any form of text, the functions such as
      <code>cairo_show_text</code> do not have much flexibility.
      To draw in, say, multiple colours will involve much work.
      Pango is a library for handling all aspects of text.
      There is a 
      <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/">
	Pango Reference Manual
      </a>.
      A good tutorial is at
      <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-u-pango2/">
	The Pango connection: Part 2
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest way of colouring text (and some other effects)
      is to create the text marked up with HTML such as
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
gchar *markup_text = "&lt;span foreground=\"red\"&gt;hello &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span foreground=\"black\"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;";
      </pre>
    <p>
      which has "hello" in red and "world" in black. This is then parsed into the
      text itself "ed black" and a set of attribute markups.
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
gchar *markup_text = "&lt;span foreground=\"red\"&gt;hello &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span foreground=\"black\"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;";
PangoAttrList *attrs;
gchar *text;

pango_parse_markup (markup_text, -1,0, &attrs, &text, NULL, NULL);
      </pre>
    

    <p>
      This can be rendered into a Cairo context by creating a
      <code>PangoLayout</code> from the Cairo context, laying out
      the text with its attributes in the Pango layout and then
      showing this layout in the Cairo context:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
PangoLayout *layout;
PangoFontDescription *desc;

cairo_move_to(cr, 300.0, 50.0);
layout = pango_cairo_create_layout (cr);
pango_layout_set_text (layout, text, -1);
pango_layout_set_attributes(layout, attrs);
pango_cairo_update_layout (cr, layout);
pango_cairo_show_layout (cr, layout);
      </pre>
    <p>
      (Yes, there is a lot of jumping around between libraries in all
      of this!).
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Just as before, once all content has been drawn into the Cairo
      context, it can be extracted as a pixbuf from the Cairo
      surface destination, set into the <code>GtkImage</code>
      and added to the Gtk event queue.
    </p>

    <p>
      The complete program is <code>gtk_play_video_pango.c</code>:
    </p>
      <pre class="sh_cpp">
	<!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/escape.pl . gtk_play_video_pango.c" -->
      </pre>
   

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      Getting to grips with some aspects of the Gtk toolkit is not trivial.
      We will use some of this material in later chapters,
      which is why it has been pulled out of the sound sections
      of this book and placed in a "diversions" section.
      Those not interested in Linux sound may nevertheless find it
      useful.
